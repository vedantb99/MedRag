The Hospital score, recognized for its predictive power in diverse settings, has yet to be extensively validated in low-income countries, particularly amid the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study validates the Hospital score for predicting 30-day readmission in a tertiary private hospital in Southern Brazil, assessing its efficacy in a middle-income country context. We retrospectively analyzed adult medical discharges from Hospital Moinhos de Vento between January 2019 and December 2023. The study focus was evaluating the Hospital score's accuracy in forecasting 30-day readmissions, including a specific assessment of its performance among COVID-19 patients during the pandemic years. Data extraction from electronic health records facilitated a comprehensive analysis of score variables and patient outcomes. Among 69\u2009971 discharges, 2890 patients were readmitted within 30 days, marking a 4.3% readmission rate. The Hospital score demonstrated consistent predictive accuracy, with an overall score accuracy of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.66-0.73; p\u2009<\u20090.01) and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.64-0.75; p\u2009<\u20090.01) among COVID-19 patients. Notably, the pandemic did not significantly impact the score's predictive validity. The Hospital score remains a reliable predictor of 30-day readmissions in a tertiary hospital within a middle-income country, retaining its effectiveness amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings underscore the score's potential as a universal tool for reducing preventable readmissions, highlighting its relevance across healthcare contexts.", "source": "PubMed"}

{"id": "41195778", "text": "To date, the gold standard for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PjP) diagnosis is direct microscopic examination (ME). However, several studies have shown that the DNA copy number of the P. jirovecii, measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), is significantly higher in patients with PjP than in colonized individuals. Nevertheless, this approach is not standardized yet and requires further investigation. In this study, we aimed to compare the results obtained using the Pneumocystis ELITe MGB Kit (ELITech Group S.p.a., Italy) with those from ME, evaluating specificity, sensitivity, and the ability to distinguish infection from colonization through the identification of a cut-off value. A total of 163 bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or sputum samples, collected and tested with direct ME for P. jirovecii in our Unit over the past 10 years, were also analyzed using a qPCR assay. The results were concordant between the two methods in all 63 ME-positive samples. Among 100 ME-negative samples, 21 (21%) tested positive by qPCR. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to assess the qPCR assay's prognostic performance in identifying patients already diagnosed with PjP by ME on BAL or sputum samples. A cut-off value of 150 DNA copies/105 cells yielded a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 94%-100%) and a specificity of 99% (95% CI: 95%-100%) in the diagnosis of the disease. qPCR may be used alongside careful clinical evaluation to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.IMPORTANCERecently, molecular approaches have been proposed for the detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii. Thanks to their high sensitivity, these methods can detect small amounts of fungal DNA. However, it is necessary to establish a cut-off value to distinguish between colonization and infection.

{"id": "41209577", "text": "The immune system plays a vital role in defending the body against infections and tumors, inspiring the development of innovative therapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that have transformed the treatment of advanced cancers. Pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor, is a powerful ICI effective against various malignancies but frequently associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs). In this report, we present a case of organizing pneumonitis that developed 3 months after initiation of pembrolizumab treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A 64-year-old woman with NSCLC, undergoing maintenance therapy with pembrolizumab, presented with multiple lung consolidations. Her medical history included thalassemia minor, a pre-pyloric ulcer, hiatal hernia, and a history of smoking. Extensive microbiological testing, including bronchoalveolar lavage, was negative, and her condition did not improve with broad-spectrum antibiotics. This led to a suspected diagnosis of pembrolizumab-induced pneumonitis. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids resulted in full clinical and radiological resolution. This case underscores the importance of monitoring for irAEs during ICI therapy, as differential diagnosis between immunotherapy-induced organizing pneumonia and tumor progression is challenging in patients with advanced lung cancer.", "source": "PubMed"}

Methods: This nationwide, multicenter, prospective observational cohort study enrolled newly diagnosed cough-variant asthma (CVA) patients from 17 hospitals across China between December 2017 and January 2020. Patients received anti-asthma treatment and were followed for 6 months. Changes in cough severity, lung function, induced sputum and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) were assessed. Type 2 inflammation was defined as sputum eosinophils \u22653%, and/or FeNO \u226550 ppb, and/or blood eosinophils \u22650.3\u00d7109 cells/L. Continuous variables were presented as mean\u00b1standard deviation or median (Q1, Q3), and intergroup comparisons were conducted using t-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), or rank-sum tests. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests. Repeated measures were analyzed using a mixed-effects model, and Cox regression was used to identify factors associated with complete cough resolution. Results: A total of 342 CVA patients (114 males and 228 females) were included, with a mean (\u00b1SD) age of (41.2\u00b112.9) years (range 18-70 years). After 2 months of treatment, the median values for lung function parameters, FeNO levels, and sputum eosinophil counts of included CVA patients returned to near-normal levels, while the greatest improvement in cough severity was observed after 4 months of treatment. In 125 (36.5%) CVA patients, cough persisted despite 6 months of treatment. Compared with patients who achieved complete cough resolution, those with persistent cough were older, had a longer disease duration, higher baseline sputum neutrophil counts, lower sputum eosinophil counts, lower FeNO levels, and a lower proportion of type 2 inflammation [42.4% (53/125) vs. 65.3% (141/216)], P=0.001).

While deep learning approaches primarily classify abnormalities from three-dimensional (3D) CT images, radiologists also incorporate clinical indications and patient demographics, such as age and sex, for diagnosis. This study aims to enhance multilabel abnormality classification and automated report generation by integrating imaging and non-imaging data. We propose a multimodal deep learning model that combines 3D chest CT scans, clinical information reports, patient age, and sex to improve diagnostic accuracy. Our method extracts visual features from 3D volumes using a visual encoder, textual features from clinical indications via a pretrained language model, and demographic features through a lightweight feedforward neural network. These extracted features are projected into a shared representation space, concatenated, and processed by a projection head to predict abnormalities. For the multilabel classification task, incorporating clinical indications and patient demographics into an existing visual encoder, called CT-Net, improves the F1 score to 51.58, representing a + \u0394 6.13 % increase over CT-Net alone. For the automated report generation task, we extend two existing methods, CT2Rep and CT-AGRG, by integrating clinical indications and demographic data. This integration enhances Clinical Efficacy metrics, yielding an F1 score improvement of + \u0394 14.78 % for the CT2Rep extension and + \u0394 6.69 % for the CT-AGRG extension. Our findings suggest that incorporating patient demographics and clinical information into deep learning frameworks can significantly improve automated CT scan analysis. This approach has the potential to enhance radiological workflows and facilitate more comprehensive and accurate abnormality detection in clinical practice.", "source": "PubMed"}

{"id": "41007559", "text": "Background: Mass gatherings like the Hajj pilgrimage present unique challenges for radiological services, with high patient volumes and increased respiratory disease risks necessitating reliable chest X-ray interpretation. Objectives: The objective of this study is to assess the diagnostic quality, abnormality rates, and peer-review concordance of chest X-rays in patients transferred during the Hajj seasons of 1444-1445 H/2023-2024 G, with an additional focus on gender-based differences in radiological interpretation. Methods and Materials: A cross-sectional analysis of 2093 chest X-rays from Hajj healthcare facilities was conducted. Two blinded radiologists independently reinterpreted images using standardized criteria. Data included demographic variables, radiographic findings (quality, opacities, nodules, cardiomegaly, effusions), and tuberculosis likelihood. Results: Among interpretable films (89.7% acceptable quality), 69.2% showed abnormalities, primarily opacities (56.4%) and cardiomegaly (27.0%). Tuberculosis was considered probable by radiographic appearance in 21.0% of cases. Peer review demonstrated 94.2% overall concordance. Regression analysis identified the presence of any abnormality (OR = 10.67, p < 0.001) and female gender (OR = 2.97, p = 0.003) as significant independent predictors of interpretive discordance. A trend towards higher discordance was noted for pulmonary nodules, though it was not statistically significant (9.4% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.062). Conclusions: While chest X-rays proved reliable for Hajj screening, gender disparities in interpretation and challenges in certain assessments, such as nodule evaluation, highlight opportunities to refine radiological protocols in mass gatherings.", "source": "PubMed"}

This study enrolled 97 children with severe pneumonia admitted to the PICU. They were classified into the pARDS group or non-pARDS group based on whether pARDS developed within 7 days of admission. LIPS and serum levels of KL-6, SP-D, vWF, and IL-8 were recorded and measured at PICU admission (T1) and at the time of pARDS diagnosis (T2). Additionally, 30 healthy children undergoing physical examination during the same period were included as the control group. At T1, the LIPS, KL-6, SP-D, vWF, and IL-8 levels were significantly higher in the pARDS group compared to the non-pARDS and control groups (P\u2009<\u20090.05). At T2, the levels of LIPS, KL-6, SP-D, vWF, and IL-8 in the pARDS group were significantly higher than those at T1 (P\u2009<\u20090.01). Logistic regression analysis showed that LIPS, KL-6, SP-D, and vWF were independent risk factors for the occurrence of pARDS in children with severe pneumonia (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated that the area under the curve for LIPS and its combination with the four serum biomarkers for predicting pARDS in children with severe pneumonia were 0.786 and 0.906, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were 73.3% and 83.3% for LIPS, and 85.1% and 91.0% for the combination of LIPS and serum biomarkers.

{"id": "41211033", "text": "Global threats, including the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine funding cuts, and persistent health inequities, are reversing decades of hard-won gains in immunisation coverage, particularly access for vulnerable populations. This highlights an urgent need to rethink how immunisation programs are designed and delivered, ensuring they are adaptable, scalable, equitable, and sustainable. Global partnerships such as Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, United Nations Children\u00b4s Fund, and World Health Organization have been instrumental in strengthening immunisation systems and success hinges on approaches deeply rooted in local contexts. This perspective piece draws on the evaluation of the 'Let\u00b4s Talk About Vaccines!' project, which used participatory strategies to co-design and implement two co-created vaccination interventions in Malawi and Mozambique. It incorporates insights from Expanded Programme on Immunisation officials, global immunisation actors, and current literature. Key insights highlight the transformative potential of community-driven immunisation interventions that prioritize local ownership, inclusive governance, and tailored communication. Six essential components identified contributing to successful interventions include 1) Collaborative planning, design and implementation; 2) Innovative and culturally relevant communication modalities; 3) Gender responsive programming; 4) Strategic integration and alignment with health and community systems and global strategies; 5) Inclusive monitoring and feedback mechanisms; and 6) Continuous reflection and adaptation that balances fidelity with flexibility. We would argue that these guiding principles, adaptable and scalable, when embedded in immunisation strategies, can enhance equity and effectiveness across diverse contexts, aligning with global strategies such as Immunisation Agenda 2030, Big Catch Up, and GAVI 6.0. As Africa celebrates 50 years of immunisation progress, we must move beyond conventional models, adopting innovative strategies that amplify community voices, ensure flexibility in program design, and support national health priorities. The future of immunisation must embrace participatory design, local innovation, sustained commitment, and relentless focus on adaptability, ensuring no one is left behind amid shifting policies and limited resources.", "source": "PubMed"}

{"id": "41196717", "text": "Surgical approaches to lung cancer resection are rapidly evolving, particularly for early-stage lung cancer. Advances in chest CT technology and increasing use of CT in patient care have led to detection of smaller nodules, many with ground-glass attenuation that do not require lobectomy for resection. Lung-sparing and minimally invasive techniques have been shown to result in improved patient outcomes compared with those of traditional open thoracotomy and are noninferior in terms of cancer recurrence. As more patients undergo these surgeries, it is important for radiologists to be aware of useful information for surgeons before the operation. It is helpful for radiologists to understand the indications for lung-sparing surgery and have a basic understanding of the techniques involved in video-assisted and robotic thoracic operations. Identification of the location and morphology of the tumor, as well as the pulmonary vasculature that feeds and drains the segment of lung containing the tumor is important. Also, the presence of emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and incomplete fissures is useful information. In addition, chest imaging is also progressing, with improvements in multiplanar reformations and three-dimensional imaging allowing for more detailed and accurate image-based localization of tumors and visualization of anatomy. Nodule localization for surgery plays an even larger role given the limited ability to palpate nodules during surgery with minimally invasive surgery approaches. Methods can involve imaging and in vivo localization, with transthoracic and bronchoscopic methods used to label a nodule. Finally, radiologists should be aware of postoperative complications and their imaging characteristics, such as suture line granulomas and bronchopleural fistulas.

{"id": "41194807", "text": "Bartonella-related culture-negative endocarditis (CNE) is an infrequent and difficult diagnosis, due to the organism's unique growth characteristics and frequent negative cultures. We describe a case of a 42-year-old previously healthy male with necrotizing pneumonia complicated by empyema and bronchopleural fistula. Despite signs of systemic inflammation and infection, multiple blood cultures remained negative. Our diagnosis was made with serologic testing, which revealed elevated Bartonella antibody levels, and echocardiographic findings of endocarditis. Bartonella species are zoonotic, time-dependent, Gram-negative bacteria most often transmitted by arthropod vectors. Cats often serve as reservoirs of the organism. Because of ambiguous clinical manifestations, early recognition is challenging unless there is initial suspicion of a zoonotic etiology. We hope this case emphasizes thinking of Bartonella and other zoonotic pathogens in CNE when routine cultures do not provide a diagnosis. Serologic testing and imaging studies are invaluable in the diagnostic process.

Following a chest X-ray, CAD produces an abnormality score, which indicates the likelihood of TB. Score thresholds informing the screening logic for both approaches were determined based on the WHO's target product profile for a TB screening test. CAD scores above a threshold prespecified for the CAD4TBv7 approach indicate confirmatory testing for TB (Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra). For the CAD4TBv7-CRP approach, a CAD score within a predefined window requires the conduct of the second screening test, CRP, while a score above the respective upper threshold is followed by Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra. A CRP result above the selected cut-off also requires a confirmatory TB test. Participants with CAD scores below the (lower) threshold and those with CRP levels below the cut-off are considered screen-negative.

Diagnostic laparoscopy and hysteroscopy have become crucial for assessing suspected FGTB cases, mainly when supported by molecular and histopathological tests. This systematic review has evaluated these modalities' diagnostic utility, sensitivity, specificity, and clinical outcomes for predicting FGTB. A comprehensive systematic review was performed with the help of the PECOS framework and PRISMA guidelines. Studies were identified by running Boolean operators and MeSH terms on seven databases: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and Google Scholar. Cohort and cross-sectional designs were considered, focusing on clinically relevant outcomes such as sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and procedural findings obtained from diagnostic laparoscopy and hysteroscopy. Data extraction was done using a standardized template, and bias was assessed using ROBINS-I and AXIS tools. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE framework, and sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the findings. Thirteen studies involving 2201 participants were included in the review. Tubal beading, adhesions, and hydrosalpinx were the constant findings of diagnostic laparoscopy, with sensitivities and specificities varying between 33% and 85.71% and 22.8% and 100%, respectively. Hysteroscopy revealed intrauterine fibrosis in up to 48.48% of cases. Adhesions and synechiae were seen in 46% and 18%, respectively. Molecular diagnostics GeneXpert and tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction (TB-PCR) showed high sensitivity (up to 100%) and varied specificity (33% to 100%). The prevalence of FGTB ranged from 6.73% to 45%, with conception rates improved by 39% postantitubercular therapy. Sensitivity analyses revealed lower heterogeneity (I\u00b2 <40%) in studies applying combined diagnostic modalities compared to single-method approaches.

Multidrug resistant bacteria (MDR) are difficult to treat and pose a formidable health challenge to clinicians. The misuse of antibiotics has augmented the rise of resistant bacteria like ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species), thus highlighting the urgent need for innovative strategies. The use of nanoparticles for disturbing bacterial growth, inhibiting biofilm formation and targeting antibiotic delivery could be a promising solution to MDR bacteria. This comprehensive review illustrates how nanoparticles cope with MDR infections due to antibacterial photodynamic therapy and use as carriers for targeted drug delivery systems. Though the applications of nanoparticles in the field of medicine to treat multidrug resistant infections is a promising solution, however, the challenges persist in translating nanoparticle-based systems into clinical settings. The main hurdles include biocompatibility, minimizing the cytotoxicity, overcoming scalability problems, and addressing regulatory and environmental concerns.

Chest radiographs (CXRs) are widely used to diagnose pediatric pneumonia; however, distinguishing between bacterial and viral etiologies on imaging is a diagnostically challenging task. Large language models (LLMs), particularly those integrated with vision capabilities, have shown promise in preliminary studies for interpreting CXR findings. However, the diagnostic performance of general-purpose LLMs without specialized medical training or add-ons remains poorly understood. This study examined whether such LLMs could independently and reliably distinguish between bacterial, viral, and normal CXRs in pediatric patients. Methods We evaluated four publicly available LLMs, such as ChatGPT o3, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3, on a dataset of 44 pediatric CXRs confirmed by human readers to show bacterial pneumonia (n = 17), viral pneumonia (n = 13), or no abnormality (n = 14). Each image was analyzed twice by each LLM using a standardized prompt, resulting in a total of eight readings per image. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed relative to human expert consensus. Internal consistency was measured by comparing repeated interpretations. A prespecified adaptive stopping rule was employed based on performance futility criteria. Sample size calculations and statistical analyses were conducted using G*Power. Results Across all models and CXR types, the average diagnostic accuracy was 31%, consistent with chance-level performance in a three-choice classification task. Accuracy was highest for viral pneumonia (54%) and lowest for normal CXRs (18%). Internal consistency ranged from 46% to 71% across models, indicating unreliable performance. Concordance with human expert interpretation did not exceed 49% for any of the models. Futility criteria were met after 44 cases, prompting early termination of data collection. Conclusion General-purpose LLMs currently available to the public are not reliable diagnostic tools for pediatric pneumonia on chest radiographs. Their accuracy is low, particularly in ruling out disease, and their responses lack internal consistency. These findings highlight the risks associated with deploying such models in unsupervised clinical or consumer-facing settings. Future research should focus on purpose-built radiologic AI tools trained on diverse, clinically representative datasets and integrated with clinician oversight to ensure the safe and effective use of these tools.", "source": "PubMed"}

This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the utility of various clinical predictors of cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) development. Methods: The study included patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis diagnosed according to the recent ATS guidelines between January 2020 and July 2024 who underwent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) due to clinical suspicion of CS. The original Lake Louise criteria were used to identify active myocarditis. Results: Out of 393 patients diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis, CMR was performed in 92 patients. Cardiac sarcoidosis was confirmed in 48 patients (52%, CS+), and excluded in 44 patients (48%, CS-). CS(+) patients demonstrated significantly more frequent Holter ECG abnormalities and liver/spleen sarcoidosis compared to CS(-) patients. Stage IV pulmonary disease, ECG abnormalities, and hypercalcemia were more common in CS(+) than in CS(-) patients; however, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Multivariate analysis identified Holter ECG abnormalities and liver/spleen involvement as significant predictive factors for CS, increasing the risk of cardiac involvement by approximately 4- and 6-fold, respectively. An AI-assisted simple scoring system based on five parameters: ECG abnormalities, Holter ECG abnormalities, liver/spleen involvement, gender, and stage of sarcoidosis predicted CS with a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 74%, using an optimal cut-off value of \u22657.6 points. Conclusions: In patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, an AI-assisted scoring algorithm derived from L1-regularized logistic regression results accurately predicted cardiac involvement on CMR with high specificity and sensitivity. Prospective validation of this algorithm is necessary to confirm its clinical utility in predicting cardiac sarcoidosis.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41179642", "text": "Strongyloidiasis, classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD), is predominantly prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, impacting an estimated 100-370 million individuals globally. The northern and southern provinces of Iran are recognized as endemic areas for this disease, characterized by environmental conditions such as optimal temperature and humidity conducive to the survival of the causative agent. Although this disease commonly presents no symptoms, individuals with compromised immune systems or those undergoing corticosteroid treatment face an elevated risk of developing hyper_infection syndrome, a serious complication with potentially fatal outcomes. In the case of immunocompromised patients, especially those receiving corticosteroid therapy, the timely diagnosis of strongyloidiasis is imperative, as the infection can lead to life-threatening outcomes. The present study reports a case of latent strongyloidiasis diagnosis using a serological method. A 68-year-old female patient, originally from Guilan Province, residing in Tehran Province, with a medical history of asthma spanning over a decade, was admitted to the hospital and prescribed corticosteroid treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The patient exhibited symptoms including shortness of breath, constipation, skin itching and abdominal bloating. Following a referral to the Diagnostic Laboratory of Strongyloidiasis at the School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, the patient was found to be positive for Strongyloides stercoralis using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Novalisa, NovaTec, Germany). The infection was successfully treated with anthelmintic drugs. It is imperative to consider strongyloidiasis in patients with a history of residing in endemic areas or immigration, and testing should be conducted before the initiation of immunosuppressive therapy. The ELISA method is a rapid and effective diagnostic tool for detecting S. stercoralis in suspected patients, particularly prior to corticosteroid treatment.", "source": "PubMed"}

We examined the association between allostatic load (AL) (a composite marker of multisystem physiological dysregulation induced by chronic stress) and asthma prevalence among U.S. adults using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005 to 2010 data. The allostatic load index (ALI) was calculated from 8 physiological biomarkers representing cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory systems and was categorized as \u22641, 2, and \u22653 for comparative analysis. Asthma was defined by self-reported physician diagnosis. Survey-weighted logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for asthma across ALI categories, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic indicators, and smoking. Of 15,533 participants (mean age 45.8 years), 2110 (13.6%) reported a history of asthma. Among these individuals, there were 40.57% ALI\u2005\u2264\u20051, 21.0% ALI\u2005=\u20052, and 38.4% ALI\u2005\u2265\u20053.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of institutional data from Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute (BIDI), Thailand, covering 2016-2023. TB detection rates were assessed across five diagnostic methods-chest radiography (CXR), smear microscopy, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining, culture, and GeneXpert MTB/RIF-relative to annual HIV-related visit volumes. Results: Among 56,599 HIV-related visits, TB detection rates varied substantially by diagnostic method. CXR was the most commonly used tool, detecting TB in up to 99 cases out of 6964 visits (1.42%) in 2016, though declining to 23 cases out of 6947 visits (0.33%) in 2023. GeneXpert was employed more consistently, yielding between 7 cases out of 7577 visits (0.09%) and 13 cases out of 6593 visits (0.20%) annually. Smear microscopy and AFB staining declined markedly, falling below 0.22% after 2020.

These CPS-related mutants, but not LPS-related mutants, showed virulence attenuation and significantly reduced colonization in mice. We demonstrate that CPS serves as the primary receptor for phage adsorption and can be cleaved by phage depolymerase Dep-Y. Phage DNA ejection was specifically triggered by purified LPS, rendering LPS a secondary receptor during the phage infection process. Furthermore, mutant phages capable of infecting the LPS-related mutant strain were isolated, leading to the identification of a novel tail fiber protein named TFP_Y, which can interact with LPS to initiate phage genome ejection. In conclusion, we propose a molecular model for phage infection in the hvKp strain SCNJ1. In this model, the phage utilizes both the CPS and LPS as receptors to initiate an infection in hvKp: the phage attaches to the bacterial cell surface; depolymerase Dep-Y degrades the host CPS to expose the LPS; and TFP_Y interacts with LPS, leading to the ejection of phage genome DNA. These findings deepen our understanding of phage-hvKp strain interactions during phage infection, which is crucial for developing phage-based therapeutic strategies.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41212188", "text": "Phage infection begins with the adsorption of the phage particle to the bacterial cell surface, followed by the injection of the phage genome into the cell. In the encapsulated hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp), the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) surrounding the bacterium was assumed to be the adsorption receptor of phage infection. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a common phage receptor in many bacteria. Whether and how CPS and LPS act as receptors simultaneously to initiate the phage infection in hvKp remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that bacterial CPS and LPS are both critical determinants for phage infection in hvKp strain SCNJ1, and mutations in either component confer complete resistance. We revealed that CPS is the primary receptor for phage adsorption, whereas LPS is the secondary receptor for phage injection. Furthermore, we identified a novel tail fiber protein TFP_Y that recognizes host LPS to start phage genome DNA release.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41211032", "text": "On 26th September 2022, the Ministry of Health received a notification of a measles outbreak in Lamwo District. Eight (8) out of the eleven blood samples collected from suspected case-persons of Palabek Gem and Palabek Ogilli Sub-Counties for testing turned positive for measles-specific IgM antibodies at the UVRI. On 29th September 2022, a team of Epidemiologists from the Ministry of Health was deployed. We conducted an epidemiological investigation to determine the scope of the outbreak, and associated risk factors to prevent further transmission. We defined a probable and confirmed case in line with Uganda's national technical guidelines for integrated disease surveillance and response. We reviewed outpatient and inpatient health facility records of all health facilities to generate a line list from 1st July to 30th September 2022. We then conducted a case-control study, with Mantel Haenszel odds ratios to determine the factors associated with the outbreak. The study identified fifty-six measles cases (48 probable and eight confirmed), with 54% being male, and 89% being South Sudanese nationals. The highest attack rate was among children <1 year (51/10,000) and Zone 8 parish in the Palabek Refugee Settlement (72/10,000). The index case was a 6-year-old South Sudanese boy who entered Uganda on 7th July 2022 and later developed symptoms on 24th July 2022. In this study, we estimated vaccination coverage and the vaccine effectiveness at 63% and 72%, respectively. Malnutrition (ORMH=3.73, 95% CI: 1.22-11.43) and receiving one or no doses of measles vaccine (ORMH=7.0, 95% CI: 2.8-17.6) were the risk factors. We recommended mass administration of vitamin A supplementation and a measles vaccine dose to children under five years of age regardless of the vaccination status. To prevent future outbreaks, we recommended improvement of nutrition and implementation of periodic measles follow-up vaccination campaigns.", "source": "PubMed"}

{"id": "41152689", "text": "Background: Proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) are widely used in pediatric populations, although hypersensitivity reactions (HSR) to these agents are rare and not well characterized in children. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and diagnostic findings of pediatric patients with suspected HSRs to PPIs. Methods: Pediatric patients referred to our allergy clinic with suspected PPI-related HSRs between January 2012 and October 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Data on demographics, reaction characteristics, comorbidities, and diagnostic test outcomes (skin-prick test, intradermal test, and drug provocation test) were collected. Results: Twenty-two patients (median age, 12 years; 81% girls) were included. Lansoprazole was the most commonly implicated PPI (64%). Clinical manifestations included urticaria (41%), anaphylaxis (36%), maculopapular eruption (14%), angioedema (4.5%), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (4.5%). Most reactions (77%) occurred within 6 hours of drug intake. Among 18 patients undergoing diagnostic evaluation, 11 were tested with the suspected PPI and 7 were tested with an alternative PPI. One patient had a positive intradermal test result to omeprazole but tolerated lansoprazole. In total, 10 patients had their PPI allergy label removed after a negative diagnostic workup; 9 tolerated an alternative PPI. Conclusion: Urticaria and anaphylaxis were the most common presentations of PPI hypersensitivity. Lansoprazole was the most frequently suspected drug. Skin testing, followed by a drug provocation test with a tolerated alternative, remains essential for diagnostic clarification. Clinicians should be aware of possible cross-reactivity among PPIs. Further pediatric studies are needed to optimize diagnostic and management strategies for PPI-induced HSRs.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41126879", "text": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is characterized by aggressive malignancy and poor prognosis often attributed to challenges in early diagnosis. Using machine learning on extensive public methylation databases (including TCGA and GEO), we developed a model that accurately distinguishes NSCLC from normal tissues (>94%), comparable to typical diagnostic methods. KAZN methylation patterns also proved informative for predicting patient survival. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses provided support for a potential causal relationship between KAZN methylation and NSCLC development. In vitro experiments validated that KAZN expression is significantly lower in NSCLC tumor tissues and cell lines compared to normal controls. Demethylation treatment significantly elevated KAZN expression in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. KAZN expression significantly affects the apoptosis and proliferation in NSCLC cell lines by potentially targeting USP2. Overall, aberrant methylation of KAZN plays an important role in NSCLC pathogenesis and KAZN methylation may serves as a useful biomarker for molecular characterization, diagnosis, and prognosis.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41203654", "text": "Drug resistance in bacteria is a major problem that calls for new classes of antimicrobial drugs. We report a biodegradable poly(imidazolium ester) (PIE), P8, with excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, high therapeutic selectivity, and an unexploited mechanism of action. P8, a short oligomer, translocates across bacterial membrane and phase separates with intracellular nucleic acids, forming biomolecular condensates. P8 binds the DNA minor groove and intercalates with DNA, interacting with it via electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions. The phase separation of nucleic acids modulated by P8 inhibits in vitro transcription, thereby impeding translation and potentially leading to cell death. Bacterial cytological profiling indicates that the antimicrobial mechanism of P8 differs from those of conventional antibiotics, though it also suggests that P8 may inhibit RNA synthesis. P8 is safe and effective against drug-resistant bacteria in murine models of systemic, intramuscular, and lung infections. This study shows the great potential of intracellular biomolecular condensate formation for combating drug-resistant bacteria.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41168391", "text": "The rapid development of deep learning has promoted its application in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis prediction. Medical imaging plays a crucial role in the management of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis/multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB/MDR-TB). In particular, chest computed tomography (CT) scans offer detailed lung images that can reveal subtle features. In this study, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model to predict treatment outcomes in RR-TB/MDR-TB patients, aiming to support clinicians in timely adjustment of therapeutic strategies and improving treatment success. The model integrates CNN for image feature extraction with LSTM for sequential analysis of patient monitoring data, including two types of immune detection indicators (T-cell subsets and peripheral blood tuberculosis-related CD161-positive cells). Transfer learning with weight initialization was applied to enhance model performance, and three backbone architectures (DenseNet201\u2009+\u2009ABC, ResNet-50\u2009+\u2009ABC, CheXNet\u2009+\u2009ABC) were compared to assess their impact on predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrated that the CNN-LSTM model with DenseNet201\u2009+\u2009ABC as the backbone achieved the highest accuracy in predicting subsequent treatment indicators. These findings demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of using CNN-LSTM for treatment outcome prediction in RR-TB/MDR-TB, and highlighted its potential to assist clinicians in precision-tailoring treatment plans, thereby improving therapeutic efficacy and offering both theoretical and practical value in healthcare.", "source": "PubMed"}

It typically affects nonsmoking middle-aged or elderly women and often presents with insidious symptoms like chronic cough, exertional dyspnea, and wheezing. Since these non-specific features may resemble asthma or other obstructive pulmonary airway diseases, the diagnosis is frequently challenging and therefore delayed. Chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) typically shows multiple small pulmonary nodules and a mosaic attenuation pattern, but histological analysis, most reliably obtained by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) biopsy, is the key to establishing the diagnosis. Herein, we report the case of an elderly woman with a 12-year history of productive cough, exertional dyspnea, and wheezing, initially misdiagnosed as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). HRCT revealed multiple small solid nodules and a mosaic attenuation pattern. On physical examination, basal crackles and squeaks were noted on lung auscultation. Following persistent symptoms and inconclusive noninvasive investigations, a VATS lung biopsy was performed, which established the diagnosis of DIPNECH. The patient was treated with systemic corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators but developed steroid-related complications without clinical improvement.

The present EUCAST breakpoints for temocillin are established based on exposure levels derived from a dosing regimen of 2 g every 8 h via intermittent infusion (II). However, the evidence supporting the efficacy of continuous infusion (CI) against ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae remains limited. The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether CI improves temocillin activity compared with II in a hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM) against CTX-M-15-producing K. pneumoniae. Four clinical isolates were characterized by whole-genome sequencing and tested for temocillin susceptibility. Mutant frequencies were estimated, and temocillin activity was assessed via time-kill assays and HFIM simulating human pharmacokinetics of temocillin 6 g/day via II and CI. Bacterial counts were performed to detect total and resistant subpopulations. Isolates showing regrowth were sequenced to identify resistance-associated mutations. The results showed that both regimens reduced bacterial burden within 8 h. However, three isolates regrew under II, while only one did under CI. CI achieved more sustained bacterial suppression and delayed or prevented the emergence of resistant subpopulations. Mutations in the cpxA gene were associated with increased temocillin MICs in regrown isolates. While both regimens demonstrated initial bactericidal activity, CI was more effective in sustaining bacterial suppression and limiting resistance emergence. These findings support the potential clinical benefit of CI for treating infections caused by CTX-M-15-producing K. pneumoniae and warrant further clinical validation.", "source": "PubMed"}

While pulmonary contusion remains the most common injury, meticulous evaluation with CT scan is crucial to rule out occult pathologies and ensure timely intervention for potential complications like alveolar hemorrhage. Pediatric chest trauma mandates a tailored management approach considering their delicate physiology. Early initiation of high-flow oxygen, judicious ventilatory support for acute respiratory distress, and proactive fluid management are essential, while pain control and hemodynamic monitoring remain critical throughout the recovery process.

We systematically profiled serum lipidomes across different CARAS stages and examined associations with inflammatory cytokines and mucins. Baseline characteristics were comparable among healthy controls (HC) and CARAS subgroups. CARAS patients in the acute phase (CARASa) exhibited elevated serum-specific IgE and fractional exhaled nitric oxide, indicating heightened allergic sensitization, while pulmonary function remained preserved. Lipidomic analysis revealed a pronounced shift from fatty acids to glycerolipids in CARASa, with upregulation of triglycerides, digalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and ceramides. CARASb (chronic persistence) showed persistent dysregulation of sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines, and membrane lipids, whereas CARASc (clinical remission) exhibited partial recovery with residual alterations in specific lipid classes. Correlation analysis indicated that fatty acid depletion strongly associated with glycerolipid accumulation. Pathway enrichment highlighted stage-dependent disturbances in fatty acid transport, GLP-1/incretin turnover, sphingolipid biosynthesis, and retinoid metabolism, reflecting metabolic-immune crosstalk. Notably, differential lipids (Digalactosyldiacylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamines and phosphatidylserine) positively correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6) and mucins (MUC1, MUC5AC) in CARASa and CARASb groups.

We describe a 50\u2011year\u2011old diabetic woman who presented during the Hajj season with acute respiratory distress, wheezing, and tachycardia and was initially treated as an acute asthma exacerbation with four consecutive nebulized salbutamol/ipratropium and a methylprednisolone 125 mg IV.

Venous blood gas analysis shortly thereafter revealed a pH of 7.21, elevated lactate, and severe hyperglycemia (random glucose >500 mg/dL), confirming DKA. Initiation of standard DKA management (insulin IV, fluid resuscitation, and electrolyte replacement) resulted in stabilization. This case highlights the risk of rapid metabolic decompensation in vulnerable patients even after a single dose of corticosteroids combined with high-dose SABA therapy and insulin omission. Atypical presentation in early DKA may include respiratory alkalosis and wheezing, which can delay diagnosis.

{"id": "41141057", "text": "Background Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease, characterised by shortness of breath (SOB), wheeze, cough and chest tightness, that has a significant impact on quality of life and global health. Previous studies have demonstrated that environmental pollutants, particularly particulate matter (PM2.5), play a key role in triggering and exacerbating asthma. Despite high atmospheric air pollution in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), there is limited region-specific research evaluating its effect on asthma symptoms. This study aimed to investigate the association between daily PM2.5 levels and patient-reported asthma symptoms in adults residing in Dubai, UAE. Methods A retrospective observational study conducted between April to June 2024, using 284 outpatient consultation records from pulmonology clinics at a single-centre, King's College Hospital London in Dubai, UAE. Inclusion criteria involved adults aged 18 and above, a formal diagnosis of asthma, and a minimum of one year of residency in Dubai prior to the study period. Symptoms, including SOB, cough, wheeze, and chest tightness, were extracted from electronic medical records. These symptoms were matched to daily PM2.5 data obtained from an online air quality server, known as IQAir. Associations were assessed using chi-square tests and logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, allergy status, pet ownership, and consultation type. Results In the final analysis, 284 consultations were included. From these, 162 were male (57%) and 122 were female (43%) participants. SOB (60.9%) and cough (46.1%) were the most frequently reported symptoms. Logistic regression revealed that higher PM2.5 categories (\"Unhealthy for sensitive groups\") were associated with a lower likelihood of reporting SOB (adjusted OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.98, p=0.045). No statistically significant associations were found between PM2.5 and cough, wheeze, or chest tightness. Age was independently associated with SOB, with the youngest group (18-29 years) having a higher incidence of SOB compared to older age groups. Conclusions Contrary to established evidence, higher PM2.5 levels were inversely associated with SOB among asthma patients in the UAE. This unexpected association should not be interpreted as suggesting a\u00a0protective role of air pollution; rather, it is more plausibly explained by numerous factors, including methodological constraints such as consultation-related confounding, or patient factors, including behavioural avoidance. Furthermore, given that these results diverge from prior research, the limited sample size and statistical power should be considered when interpreting the findings. As the first pilot study in the UAE linking daily air quality with clinical asthma outcomes, it is evident that larger, long-term studies incorporating seasonal variations and additional pollutants are necessary.", "source": "PubMed"}

{"id": "41189593", "text": "Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii) threatens immunocompromised patients, yet its role in the lung microbiome remains unclear. We performed metagenomic sequencing on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from two retrospective cohorts: a multicenter study of 1,737 patients with pneumonia and a validation cohort of 72 intubated ICU patients. Participants were categorized into P. jirovecii infection, colonization, or negative groups based on qPCR and clinical characteristics. Our analysis revealed minimal bacterial differences but significant viral and fungal variations. Notably, negative patients with P. jirovecii exhibited the lowest viral diversity. Even after adjusting for potential confounders, including immunosuppression and disease severity, P. jirovecii status remained most strongly associated with virome alterations. Furthermore, in cytomegalovirus-positive individuals, P. jirovecii positivity was significantly associated with higher 28-day mortality. These findings suggest that P. jirovecii colonization represents a distinct intermediate state in the lung microbial ecosystem between infection and negative, shedding light on its potential role in pneumonia pathogenesis and outcomes.", "source": "PubMed"}

Understanding AVN's pathogenesis and risk factors as a consequence of COVID-19 is essential for improving treatment and identifying preventive measures. This retrospective cohort study aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the etiology of AVN and raise awareness among clinicians. The study analyzed patients diagnosed with AVN and treated with Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy at G\u00fclhane Training and Research Hospital from January 2018 to January 2023. Patients were categorized into two groups: those admitted before the pandemic (the control group) and those admitted after (the study group). The results showed a significant increase in AVN cases during the post-pandemic period, with a higher incidence of femoral head involvement and more advanced stages of AVN in patients with a history of COVID-19. The findings suggest that COVID-19 and high-dose steroid use may increase AVN risk, highlighting the need for careful steroid management and monitoring for joint pain in these patients. Further research is recommended to explore the link between COVID-19 and AVN, the duration of symptoms, and the prognostic implications.", "source": "PubMed"}

Interleukin-31 (IL-31), primarily produced by Th2 cells and other immune and structural cells, has emerged as a pivotal mediator in these conditions. By activating the JAK/STAT and MAPK signaling, IL-31 drives chemokine release, eosinophil recruitment, mucus hypersecretion, and neuroimmune responses. Clinical studies demonstrate that IL-31 levels are elevated and correlate with disease severity, positioning IL-31 as a promising biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response monitoring. Importantly, IL-31 uniquely links type 2 inflammation with sensory nerve dysfunction, addressing unmet clinical needs not fully resolved by conventional IL-4/IL-5-targeted therapies. In this review, we synthesize current mechanistic and clinical evidence on IL-31 in asthma, AR, and CRSwNP, highlight its distinct value compared with other cytokines, and outline the major challenges and research questions that remain unanswered.

{"id": "41155411", "text": "Long COVID, also referred to as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), is characterized by persistent multi-systemic symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive impairment, and respiratory dysfunction. Accumulating evidence indicates that gut and oral microbiota play an important role in its pathogenesis. Patients with long COVID consistently exhibit reduced microbial diversity, depletion of beneficial short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing species such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium spp. and enrichment of proinflammatory taxa including Ruminococcus gnavus, Bacteroides vulgatus, and Veillonella. These alterations may disrupt intestinal barrier integrity, sustain low-grade systemic inflammation, and influence host immune and neuroendocrine pathways through the gut-brain and gut-lung axes. Distinct microbial signatures have also been associated with symptom clusters, including neuropsychiatric, respiratory, and gastrointestinal manifestations. Proposed mechanisms linking dysbiosis to long COVID include impaired SCFA metabolism, tryptophan depletion, microbial translocation, and interactions with host immune and inflammatory responses, including autoantibody formation and viral antigen persistence. Preliminary interventional studies using probiotics, synbiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation suggest that microbiome-targeted therapies may alleviate symptoms, although evidence remains limited and heterogeneous. This review synthesizes current literature on the role of gut and oral microbiota in long COVID, highlights emerging microbial biomarkers, and discusses therapeutic implications. While causality remains to be firmly established, restoring microbial balance represents a promising avenue for diagnosis, prevention, and management of long COVID.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "40864130", "text": "Human brucellosis is a zoonotic, bacterial infection caused by the intracellular, Gram-negative Brucella spp., which is common globally but rare in the United Kingdom, with approximately 20 imported cases per annum following travel to countries with high endemicity. Transmission typically occurs via the ingestion of infected animal products, including unpasteurised dairy products. Human-to-human transmission is rare, and routes include postpartum vertical transmission through breastfeeding. We report here on a familial cluster of three cases within a single UK-based Kurdish household of four, including a 11-month-old infant infected through the consumption of breast milk. Four months prior to presentation, the family had travelled together to northern Iraq for a 5-week holiday and all consumed local dairy products except for the children, including the 11-month-old, who was exclusively breastfed at the time. All three patients, including one adult male with complicated brucellosis, had a favourable outcome with medical therapy.: Brucellosis is an important differential diagnosis in returning travellers and specialist advice should be obtained early to prevent sequelae. It is also important for active case-finding, especially in family units with shared exposure. Paediatricians and adult physicians who may manage brucellosis should consider the possibility of vertical transmission in breastfeeding mothers.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "40929179", "text": "Population-wide screening may accelerate the decline of tuberculosis (TB) incidence, but the optimal screening algorithm and duration must weigh resource considerations. We calibrated a deterministic transmission model to TB epidemiology in Viet Nam. We simulated three population-wide screening algorithms from 2025: sputum nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra) only; chest radiography (CXR) followed by NAAT; and CXR-only without microbiological confirmation. We determined the annual screening rounds required to reduce pulmonary TB prevalence below 50 per 100,000 people. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), representing the additional costs (in US$) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted compared to business-as-usual by 2050. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of NAAT cartridges costing US$1 each. NAAT-based algorithms required at least six rounds to reach the prevalence threshold, while CXR-only required three. NAAT-only achieved a prevalence reduction consistent with the ACT3 trial after three rounds. The CXR+NAAT algorithm averted 4.29m DALYs (95%UI:2.86-6.14) at US$225 (95%UI:85-520) per DALY averted compared with business-as-usual. The front-loaded investment of US$161m (95%UI:111-224) annually during the intervention resulted in average annual cost savings of US$12.7m (95%UI:6.7-21.4) up to 2050 compared to the business-as-usual counterfactual. Reducing the cost of NAAT to US$1 led to a 50% and 15% reduction in budget impact and a 63% and 26% reduction in the estimated ICER for the NAAT-only and CXR+NAAT algorithms, respectively. In Viet Nam, population-wide screening could achieve ambitious policy goals. Substantial front-loaded investment is immediately followed by persistent cost savings and could be further offset by more affordable NAATs.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41204114", "text": "Bats are recognized for harboring a diverse array of viruses without manifesting disease symptoms. In this study, we explored the single-cell atlas of wild Rhinolophus affinis (R. affinis) using Viral-Track and identified transcript expression of eight viral species in the R. affinis lung and three viral species in the kidney. Within the R. affinis lung, these viruses were detected across all cell types except ciliated cells. Compared to uninfected cells, virus-infected cells exhibited activation of pathways associated with protein synthesis, tissue repair, and immune responses, as evidenced by increased expression of corresponding genes. Ligand-receptor based analysis revealed that viral infection reshapes intercellular communication networks in the bat lung, with infected fibroblasts and infected proliferative T cells exhibiting enhanced signaling linked to tissue remodeling and immune activation. Through gene module analysis, we identified an immune cell activation-related module by high expression of CD14, CD74, and MRC1, as well as an antiviral related module by elevated expression of SAMHD1, SLC11A1, TYROBP, and IL18 in R. affinis pulmonary macrophages. Additionally, a cross-species single-cell transcriptomic comparative analysis demonstrated that R. affinis pulmonary macrophages exhibit elevated expression of pro-inflammatory genes (IRF9, DDX5, IL6ST and ITGA4), which are associated with antiviral activity and immune activation, and anti-inflammatory genes (IRF2, PTPRE and GPR65), which play critical roles in mitigating excessive immune responses. Compared to the other species, R. affinis pulmonary macrophages exhibited upregulation of genes enriched in pathways related to vacuolar acidification and negative regulation of response to external stimulus. These findings suggest that the R. affinis lung possesses a unique immune system that enables it to balance immune responses during viral infections, thereby preventing excessive immune damage and maintaining lung tissue homeostasis. Our study provides valuable insights into the viral infection risk organs in R. affinis and their distinctive antiviral immune responses.", "source": "PubMed"}

In this matched case-control study, the prevalence of asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis was evaluated among 173 children with celiac disease and 173 age- and sex-matched healthy controls in Zahedan, Iran, in 2023. The diagnosis of celiac disease was based on European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines. Allergic conditions were assessed using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood questionnaire and confirmed through clinical evaluation. Children with celiac disease had a significantly higher prevalence of asthma (12.1% versus 5.8%; odds ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.15 to 4.05) and allergic rhinitis (29.5% versus 14.5%; odds ratio, 2.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.26) compared to controls. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of atopic dermatitis between the two groups (12.1% versus 9.2%; odds ratio, 1.35).

MFNet employs Fusion Blocks with self-calibrated convolution (SCConv) and Attention Feature Fusion (AFF) to capture multiscale semantic features, and integrates a custom activation function, MFReLU, which is employed to reduce the model's memory access time. A fusion module adaptively combines features from both networks. Experimental results show that AMFNet achieves 97.48% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.9781 on public datasets, outperforming models like ResNet50, DenseNet121, ConvNeXt-Tiny, and Vision Transformer while using fewer parameters.", "source": "PubMed"}

Patients underwent routine blood tests and data assessment upon admission. Based on the occurrence of MACE by day 28, patients were divided into the MACE group and the non-MACE (N-MACE) group. Clinical data were collected, and logistic regression, along with restricted cubic spline models, analyzed the relationships between SII, Trx-2, and MACE risk in SCM patients. Among the 98 SCM patients included, there were 35 (35.71%) in the MACE group and 63 (64.29%) in the N-MACE group. Logistic regression analysis showed that elevated SII and serum Trx-2 levels correlated with an increased risk of MACE within 28 days post-admission for SCM patients.

Here, we identify hyperforin, a natural product derived from Hypericum perforatum, as a potent polymyxin B adjuvant capable of restoring its antibacterial activity against clinical Gram-negative isolates with high-level polymyxin resistance. Using a suite of in vitro assays, including fractional inhibitory concentration index, time-kill kinetics, biofilm eradication, membrane integrity assays, and ultrastructural imaging of the bacterial outer membrane, we show that hyperforin significantly enhances polymyxin B-mediated bacterial killing. Microscopy and N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine uptake are consistent with membrane perturbation, and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species is consistent with oxidative stress under combination treatment. Taken together, these orthogonal readouts support a working model of complementary membrane perturbation and oxidative stress. Remarkably, the observed synergistic effects occur at concentrations potentially achievable in the epithelial lining fluid of the lungs, providing a testable rationale for localized lung delivery (e.g., via a dry-powder inhaler).

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of timely and all-cause mortality estimates for being able to respond to changing trends in health outcomes, showing a strong need for demographic analysis tools that can produce all-cause mortality estimates more rapidly with more readily available all-age vital registration (VR) data. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is an ongoing research effort that quantifies human health by estimating a range of epidemiological quantities of interest across time, age, sex, location, cause, and risk. This study-part of the latest GBD release, GBD 2023-aims to provide new and updated estimates of all-cause mortality and life expectancy for 1950 to 2023 using a novel statistical model that accounts for complex correlation structures in demographic data across age and time.", "source": "PubMed"}

For the first time, we used complete birth history data for ages 5-14 years, age-specific sibling history data for ages 15-49 years, and age-specific mortality data from Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems. We developed a single statistical model that incorporates both parametric and non-parametric methods, referred to as OneMod, to produce estimates of all-cause mortality for each age-sex-location group. OneMod includes two main steps: a detailed regression analysis with a generalised linear modelling tool that accounts for age-specific covariate effects such as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and a population attributable fraction (PAF) for all risk factors combined; and a non-parametric analysis of residuals using a multivariate kernel regression model that smooths across age and time to adaptably follow trends in the data without overfitting. We calibrated asymptotic uncertainty estimates using Pearson residuals to produce 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) and corresponding 1000 draws. Life expectancy was calculated from age-specific mortality rates with standard demographic methods.

{"id": "41109832", "text": "Congenital lung malformations (CLMs) encompass a range of developmental anomalies, including congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS), congenital lobar overinflation (CLO), bronchogenic cysts (BC), and bronchial atresia (BA). These lesions present with varying severity, from incidental findings to severe neonatal respiratory distress. Advances in prenatal imaging, such as ultrasound and fetal magnetic resonance image (MRI), have significantly improved early detection, aiding in better management planning. CLMs arise from abnormalities during specific stages of lung development. CPAMs are categorized by cyst size and histological type, while BPS is characterized by systemic arterial supply. CLO and BA are associated with air trapping and hyperinflation, and BCs are typically fluid-filled, well defined, and compressive. Postnatal diagnosis is based on high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and occasionally MRI for detailed evaluation. Surgical resection is recommended for symptomatic lesions, while management of asymptomatic cases remains debated. Elective surgery may help prevent complications like infection or rare malignancy, particularly in CPAM Types 1 and 4 and BCs. However, some lesions remain stable or regress, supporting conservative management in selected cases. Long-term outcomes are generally positive, with children undergoing early resection often maintaining good lung function due to compensatory lung growth, though subtle functional deficits may persist. Risk stratification using imaging and genetic markers, such as DICER1 mutations, is gaining importance for guiding treatment decisions. Management should be individualized, involving a multidisciplinary approach and shared decision-making with families.

{"id": "40865992", "text": "Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease where extrapulmonary presentation of the disease often goes unrecognized as it overlaps with many disease manifestations. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) can be complicated by hypercalcemia and encephalopathy, both potential signs of sarcoidosis. These numerous extrapulmonary presentations may delay timely diagnosis and treatment. In this case report, a 53-year-old male with ESRD was admitted following an unresponsive episode during routine hemodialysis, later found to have sarcoidosis. Initial presentation notable for hypothermia, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and metabolic derangements. Bronchoalveolar lavage cultures subsequently grew methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, successfully treated with cefazolin. However, the patient remained encephalopathic and hypercalcemic. Further workup showed nonparathyroid hormone-mediated hypercalcemia with a normal 25-OH vitamin D and elevated 1,25-OH vitamin D, concerning for sarcoidosis, malignancy, or tuberculosis. Additional computed tomography imaging and endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy illustrated enlarged lymph nodes with splenomegaly and nonnecrotizing granulomas, respectively, confirming the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. He was started on methylprednisolone, pantoprazole, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia prophylaxis; serum calcium levels started to drop, and his mentation improved. While his encephalopathy was initially presumed secondary to his ESRD and infection, further workup revealed sarcoidosis. Untreated sarcoidosis has significant health complications including lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, heart arrhythmias, and neurological deficits. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a broad differential in the setting of critically ill patients as clinical presentations can be multifactorial. Furthermore, patients with a complex medical history such as ESRD on hemodialysis can make concluding sarcoidosis as a diagnosis more difficult.", "source": "PubMed"}

Its pathophysiology is complex and multifactorial, involving alterations in intestinal barrier integrity, gut microbiota dysbiosis, activation of innate and adaptive immune responses, and neuroimmune interactions. These alterations, however, are not specific to NCWS and may also be observed in other conditions. Emerging evidence highlights the role of non-gluten wheat components, gut dysbiosis, and neuro-immune interactions exacerbating immune responses and visceral hypersensitivity. Clinically, NCWS patients present with a wide spectrum of gastrointestinal symptoms and extraintestinal manifestations including fatigue and neuropsychiatric disorders, underscoring the need for a multidisciplinary approach. Diagnosis remains challenging due to the absence of validated biomarkers. It is predominantly based on the exclusion of celiac disease and wheat allergy, symptom resolution upon wheat withdrawal, and symptom recurrence after blinded wheat exposure, as recommended by the Salerno Experts' Criteria. Current management primarily involves dietary interventions, such as gluten-free or wheat-free diets, often complemented by low-FODMAP diets and strategies targeting microbiome modulation.

{"id": "41199537", "text": "BACKGROUND Pseudoachalasia is a rare condition, with up to 4% of cases presenting with achalasia-like symptoms. The early diagnosis of pseudoachalasia can be challenging due to nonspecific manifestations and the limited diagnostic yield of imaging modalities. This report presents the case of a 62-year-old man with a delayed presentation of pseudoachalasia with negative results of various diagnostic methods. CASE REPORT A 62-year-old man with long-term tobacco use and gastroesophageal reflux disease presented with a 2-year history of dysphagia, progressively worsening in the 2 months before this admission. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) demonstrated an increased difficulty passing through the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) within a 1-month period. High-resolution manometry suggested EGJ outflow obstruction. Chest magnetic resonance imaging and a computed tomography scan showed a small nodule of the upper lobe of the left lung, suspected to be a tuberculosis lesion, no dilated esophagus, mild thickening of the muscle layer of the distal esophagus, and EGJ. An endoscopic ultrasound was performed, and no clues of malignancy were found. After a failed peroral endoscopic myotomy, a nasogastric tube was placed for nutrition support. Multiple biopsies produced normal findings. After 3 sessions of pneumatic dilation, with rapid recurrence of dysphagia and a failed stent replacement, surgical intervention was performed, revealing adenocarcinoma at the EGJ. CONCLUSIONS Pseudoachalasia due to EGJ adenocarcinoma should be suspected in patients without weight loss, regardless of the duration of symptom onset or imaging findings. Surgical exploration may be warranted early in selected patients when a definitive diagnosis of pseudoachalasia remains elusive despite extensive investigation.", "source": "PubMed"}

In this sense, survival rates after transplantation of various organs have been progressively increasing, especially in the case of lung transplants, whose average survival rate is usually lower than that of other types of solid organ transplants. Thus, detecting acute and subclinical rejection and chronic allograft rejection of any implant is important. This is important in all transplants, such as heart and lung transplants. In this last type of transplant, particularly, and due to the chronic dysfunction of the lung allograft, it is key to detect rejection early and on time, since it can reach close to half of the transplant patient population.

Every automatically detected spike of VT from the cohort was analyzed by two experienced raters using continuous volume and flow-over-time graphs reconstructed from high resolution data acquisition. In the validation cohort, 203 automatically detected spikes of VT were visually analyzed by two raters. Of the 203 detected spikes, 199 corresponded to a sigh. The Cohen's Kappa (95% CI) between the raters was 0.89 (0.67-1). In conclusion, we developed a simple automated method for the objective quantification of sighs during CPET.

{"id": "40784939", "text": "The development and refinement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms have been an area of intense research in radiology and pathology, particularly for automated or computer-aided diagnosis. Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) has emerged as a promising tool for developing and utilizing such algorithms in diagnostic and experimental pathology. However, patch-wise analysis of WSIs often falls short of capturing the intricate cell-level interactions within local microenvironment. A robust alternative to address this limitation involves leveraging cell graph representations, thereby enabling a more detailed analysis of local cell interactions. These cell graphs encapsulate the local spatial arrangement of cells in histopathology images, a factor proven to have significant prognostic value. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can effectively utilize these spatial feature representations and other features, demonstrating promising performance across classification tasks of varying complexities. It is also feasible to distill the knowledge acquired by deep neural networks to smaller student models through knowledge distillation (KD), achieving goals such as model compression and performance enhancement. Traditional approaches for constructing cell graphs generally rely on edge thresholds defined by sparsity/density or the assumption that nearby cells interact. However, such methods may fail to capture biologically meaningful interactions. Additionally, existing works in knowledge distillation primarily focus on distilling knowledge between neural networks. We designed cell graphs with biologically informed edge thresholds or criteria to address these limitations, moving beyond density/sparsity-based definitions. Furthermore, we demonstrated that student models do not need to be neural networks. Even non-neural models can learn from a neural network teacher. We evaluated our approach across varying dataset complexities, including the presence or absence of distribution shifts, varying degrees of imbalance, and different levels of graph complexity for training GNNs. We also investigated whether softened probabilities obtained from calibrated logits offered better guidance than raw logits. Our experiments revealed that the teacher's guidance was effective when distribution shifts existed in the data. The teacher model demonstrated decent performance due to its higher complexity and ability to use cell graph structures and features. Its logits provided rich information and regularization to students, mitigating the risk of overfitting the training distribution. We also examined the differences in feature importance between student models trained with the teacher's logits and their counterparts trained on hard labels. In particular, the student model demonstrated a stronger emphasis on morphological features in the Tuberculosis (TB) dataset than the models trained with hard labels. This emphasis aligns closely with the features that pathologists typically prioritize for diagnostic purposes. Future work could explore designing alternative teacher models, evaluating the proposed approach on larger datasets, and investigating causal knowledge distillation as a potential extension.", "source": "PubMed"}

This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of a purified polysaccharide, Glycyrrhiza polysaccharide fraction 2 (GCP-2), derived from Glycyrrhiza uralensis (liquorice), in a murine model of LPS-induced ALI. GCP-2 was obtained through a multi-step purification process involving aqueous extraction, ethanol precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, and size-exclusion chromatography. ALI was induced in mice via intranasal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), followed by GCP-2 treatment. Key outcomes were assessed using ELISA, qPCR, histopathology, and western blotting, while gut microbiota changes were evaluated by 16S rRNA sequencing. The results demonstrated that GCP-2 significantly alleviated lung injury, reduced pulmonary and systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, restored barrier-related proteins such as Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin, and improved histopathological features. Mechanistic studies revealed that these effects were mediated through the selective inhibition of the TLR4/NF-\u03baB signalling pathway. Additionally, GCP-2 modulated gut microbiota composition by increasing beneficial taxa such as Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacteria, while suppressing Firmicutes and Proteobacteria.

{"id": "41194827", "text": "Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is an opportunistic infection caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii. It typically occurs in patients with advanced HIV infection and severely reduced CD4+ T cell counts, but it is also seen in other immunocompromised hosts such as those receiving long-term corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, or chemotherapy. Common symptoms include progressive dyspnea, dry cough, and low-grade fever. In general, patients at risk for PCP who are receiving the equivalent of 20 mg/day or more of prednisolone for at least eight weeks are recommended to receive prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) therapy. We report our experience of managing PCP in an 80-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis who had been receiving oral prednisolone 4 mg/day for 21 years. The patient was admitted to our hospital for rehabilitation due to disuse syndrome following surgery for aortic dissection. On hospital day one, the patient developed a fever. Oxygenation impairment was observed, prompting chest radiography and subsequent computed tomography (CT) imaging, which revealed reticular shadows and ground-glass opacities in both lung fields. These findings led to the suspicion of bacterial pneumonia and initiation of ceftriaxone therapy. By day four, his oxygen saturation dropped to 90% on room air, and laboratory tests showed a \u03b2-d-glucan level of 62.5 pg/ml. On day five, the antibiotic regimen was switched to meropenem, vancomycin, and TMP-SMX. Bronchoscopy was considered unsafe because of the patient's general condition, and sputum polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed instead, which was positive for\u00a0Pneumocystis jirovecii. Based on the PCR results, clinical course, and imaging findings, a diagnosis of PCP was made. ST and atovaquone were administered for a total of three weeks, resulting in defervescence and significant improvement in oxygenation. Even low-dose corticosteroid therapy is associated with an increased risk of opportunistic infections, depending on the cumulative dose. Although our patient had been receiving only a low daily dose, the cumulative exposure indicated a high risk for infections such as PCP. In conclusion, our case experience suggests that in patients receiving long-term corticosteroid therapy, PCP and other opportunistic infections must be considered in the differential diagnosis of pneumonia, regardless of the daily corticosteroid dose received.", "source": "PubMed"}

This retrospective cohort study included 165 patients with thyroid cancer who underwent surgery. The value and clinical applicability of PIV and other immune-inflammatory biomarkers in assessing disease-free survival (DFS) were compared based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA). Patients were divided into high and low PIV groups according to the optimal cutoff value to assess the correlation between PIV and pathological characteristics. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for DFS analysis, and a Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyze the factors affecting DFS. The AUC of PIV for predicting DFS was higher than that of other immune-inflammatory biomarkers, and PIV demonstrated the highest clinical utility. Compared with the low PIV group, the high PIV group had a lower proportion of papillary thyroid carcinoma, a higher proportion of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, and higher rates of stage III-IV disease, lymph node metastasis, maximum tumor diameter \u22652\u00a0cm, and multiple lesions. The DFS was significantly shorter in the high PIV group than in the low PIV group. After adjusting for confounding factors, a high PIV level was an independent risk factor for poor surgical outcomes. In conclusion, preoperative PIV is associated with the pathological type of thyroid cancer, TNM stage, lymph node metastasis status, and maximum tumor diameter. Furthermore, a high PIV level can increase the risk of poor surgical outcomes.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41137279", "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma are common and serious respiratory diseases worldwide. Their clinical overlap and lack of specificity in current biomarkers pose a great diagnostic challenge for early diagnosis. To address this gap, this study aimed to identify common transcriptomic features and potential diagnostic biomarkers for the diseases using an integrated bioinformatics approach. This study analyzed COPD chip data using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, identifying 375 key differential genes. Functional enrichment analysis was performed to assess the biological roles of these genes. Machine learning methods, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and random forest, were employed to identify 5 key biomarkers: MYO16, CHML, POLR3B, ZNF101, and ZNF143. The findings revealed that the identified genes were primarily associated with immune response and T cell-related inflammatory pathways. Among the biomarkers, ZNF143 was significantly upregulated in both COPD and asthma, with expression levels notably higher in COPD patients compared to asthma patients. Expression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve assessment validated ZNF143 as a potential diagnostic biomarker. Additionally, the CIBERSORT algorithm was used to evaluate immune cell infiltration, revealing a positive correlation between ZNF143 and CD8 T cells, M2 macrophages, and \u03b3-\u03b4 T cells, and a negative correlation with memory-activated CD4 T cells, plasma cells, and neutrophils. These findings suggest a potential role for ZNF143 in both COPD and asthma, supporting its candidacy as an early diagnostic biomarker.

UAPA is linked to an altered development of the sixth aortic arch segment, resulting in the proximal interruption of the pulmonary artery and it often occurs on the side of the chest opposite the aortic arch [1]. As a compensatory mechanism, major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs) arise from systemic arteries to supply distal intrapulmonary branches of the atretic pulmonary artery. MAPCAs can originate from various vessels, including the descending aorta, bronchial, intercostal, internal mammary, subclavian, or even coronary arteries. Patients with UAPA may present with diverse clinical symptoms, including chest pain, pleural effusion, recurrent infections, dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and hemoptysis [1, 2].

{"id": "41218593", "text": "Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a unique, wall-less bacterium and a leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia in school-aged children. Epidemiologically, M. pneumoniae causes endemic and epidemic infections every 3-5 years, with recent surges noted globally since mid-2023. Diagnostic challenges persist; although polymerase chain reaction and serology are widely used, both carry risks of false positives or negatives owing to prolonged shedding or delayed antibody responses, respectively. Novel approaches such as ELISpot assays for antibody-secreting cells may improve diagnostic accuracy. Macrolides remain the first-line treatment in children because of the toxicity of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. However, macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (MRMP) has emerged as a major concern, especially in the Western Pacific Region (South Korea, China, and Japan), where resistance rates have exceeded 80% in recent years. Resistance is developed by 23S rRNA mutations (notably A2063G) and driven primarily by macrolide over usage and clonal expansion-particularly in sequence type 3 strains. Despite high resistance rates, many M. pneumoniae pneumonia cases remain self-limiting, and clinical outcomes are not substantially different between macrolide-sensitive and macrolide-resistant infections. Clinical studies show that while MRMP is associated with longer fever and hospital stays, it rarely increases severity. Tetracyclines and quinolones have been shown to lead to faster fever resolution in MRMP patients, and treatment guidelines now recommend switching to second-line agents when macrolide-refractory disease is suspected. Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of patients recover spontaneously, regardless of antibiotic choice, likely owing to the self-limiting nature of the pathogen, misdiagnosis of viral infections, or the immunomodulatory effects of macrolides. Amid rising MRMP, this review highlights the complex interplay between bacterial resistance, diagnostic limitations, and host factors in shaping M. pneumoniae disease outcomes.", "source": "PubMed"}

{"id": "41152686", "text": "Background: Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and selective immunoglobulin G (IgG) deficiency (sIgGD) are primary antibody deficiencies with divergent clinical trajectories. CVID is characterized by recurrent infections and systemic noninfectious complications, whereas sIgGD typically follows a milder course. Despite sharing clinical features such as recurrent infections, comparative data on complications and mortality remain limited, which hinders risk-stratified management. Objective: This study compared the prevalence, clinical impact, and mortality associated with noninfectious complications in CVID and sIgGD, and identified predictors of adverse outcomes to support risk-stratified management and examined clinical differences within the CVID group based on baseline serum IgM levels. Methods: A single-center retrospective cohort study (2018-2024) included 111 patients with CVID and 19 patients with sIgGD. Diagnostic criteria for CVID included hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG level < 400 mg/dL with low IgA/IgM), impaired vaccine responses, and exclusion of secondary causes. The sIgGD required isolated IgG deficiency with normal IgA/IgM and intact vaccine responses. Noninfectious complications, including organ-specific and systemic manifestations as well as bronchiectasis were evaluated. In patients with CVID, a predefined subgroup analysis was performed based on baseline serum IgM levels (normal versus <40 mg/dL). Multivariate logistic regression identified mortality predictors. Results: The patients with CVID exhibited significantly higher rates of recurrent sinopulmonary infections (70.3% versus 42.1%), bronchiectasis (46.8% versus 21.1%), and noninfectious complications (57.7% versus 31.6%), including autoimmune disorders such as hematologic manifestations (33.3% versus 10.5%). In the CVID group, the patients with low IgM levels exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of gastrointestinal involvement (24.0% versus 5.6%; p = 0.035). Bronchiectasis (odds ratio [OR] 5.22) and noninfectious complications (OR 7.95) independently predicted mortality in CVID. Male sex showed borderline risk. In contrast, no mortality was observed in the sIgGD cohort over the study period. Conclusion: CVID is associated with substantial noninfectious morbidity and mortality, which necessitates early identification and long-term monitoring. In contrast, sIgGD exhibits a milder clinical phenotype, although preventive care remains important.

This study aimed to develop and validate a TRIPOD-compliant clinical prediction model for early identification of atypical aPTB in this vulnerable population. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 5651 patients aged \u226575 years with culture-confirmed aPTB and World Health Organization (WHO) symptom scores < 5. Patients were stratified into Group a (Ga, Patients with aPTB not initially suspected by non-pulmonologists (atypical presentation, WHO/CDC 7-point score < 5, n = 1155) and Group b (Gb, Patients without aPTB within the first 24 h (non-TB comparators), n = 4496). Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of delayed diagnosis. A weighted scoring system was derived from \u03b2-coefficients and validated in independent derivation (2000-2020) and temporal validation (2021-2023) cohorts. Model discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were assessed following TRIPOD standards. Results: Five independent predictors-age > 85 years (OR = 6.31, 95% CI = 5.31-8.72), hypoalbuminemia (OR = 4.10, 95% CI = 3.92-7.26), cardiovascular disease (OR = 3.32, 95% CI = 1.23-5.27), diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.32-4.07), and predominant lower-lung field involvement (OR = 1.25,95% CI = 1.03-2.44)-were incorporated into the scoring model. Using a cutoff \u2265 7, the model achieved excellent performance across all cohorts (AUC 0.95-0.96; sensitivity 91-94%; specificity 97-99%). Calibration plots and DCA confirmed strong agreement and high net clinical benefit. Nearly 70% of atypical cases had symptom scores \u2264 1, lacking typical signs such as fever or cough. Conclusions: Oldest-old (>85 years) emerged as the strongest independent predictor of atypical TB, surpassing conventional frailty indicators such as sarcopenia or osteoporosis. The proposed score provides a simple, accurate, and validated tool for early detection of aPTB in non-pulmonology settings.

{"id": "41152685", "text": "Background: Ondansetron is a common antiemetic that rarely causes hypersensitivity. Skin-prick testing (SPT) and intradermal testing (IDT) may assist in diagnosing ondansetron hypersensitivity; however, their sensitivity, specificity, and optimal concentrations remain unclear. To our knowledge, drug provocation testing (DPT), the criterion standard for diagnosis, has not been previously applied in pediatric cases. Objective: In this study, we aimed to evaluate ondansetron hypersensitivity in children by using a preliminary diagnostic approach that incorporated SPT, IDT, and DPT. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed pediatric patients who were evaluated for suspected ondansetron hypersensitivity between 2019 and 2025. We performed an SPT by using an ondansetron concentration of 2 mg/mL, followed by an IDT with concentrations of 0.02 and 0.2 mg/mL in patients with negative SPT results. In cases of patients with negative skin test results, we conducted DPTs. Results: We included seven pediatric patients ages 3-16 years. All had negative SPT results, which underscores its limited sensitivity. IDT results were positive in three patients with a history of anaphylaxis (one at 0.02 mg/mL, two at 0.2 mg/mL); DPT was not performed in these patients. Among the four with negative skin test results, DPT was performed in three and yielded negative results. We confirmed hypersensitivity in three patients. In another three, no clinical reactivity was observed at the time of DPT, and the diagnosis remained inconclusive in one patient. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric case series to propose a preliminary diagnostic approach that incorporated DPT in the evaluation of suspected ondansetron hypersensitivity. The findings highlight the limited sensitivity of SPT, emphasize the diagnostic value of IDT, particularly in patients with anaphylaxis, and support the safe applicability of DPT in patients with negative skin test results, with all three DPTs yielding negative results.", "source": "PubMed"}

{"id": "40978840", "text": "Background and objectives Recurrent pleural effusion has always posed a challenge for definitive etiological diagnosis because it relies on nonspecific investigative methods like pleural fluid analysis.The basic nature of fluid, like transudate or exudate, can be differentiated by Light's criteria. The common causes of exudative effusion are tuberculosis, malignancy, and pneumonia. The non-specific method of diagnosis mainly depends upon pleural fluid biochemical and cytological tests in order to decide an empirical treatment. The blind method of pleural biopsy by introducing a specialized pleural biopsy needle into the pleural cavity is also not promising for accurate histopathological study in order to reach a definitive etiological diagnosis in exudative pleural effusion patients. The aim and objectives of this study are to determine the role and efficacy of medical thoracoscopy for definitive diagnosis in patients having exudative pleural effusion. Methods The study was carried out by taking a sample size of 61 patients fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria, having recurrent exudative pleural effusion as per Light's criteria, admitted in the pulmonary medicine department of Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences over a period of two years (2023-2025). All cases were subjected to medical thoracoscopy in the designated procedural suite of this hospital after doing the required investigations.\u00a0Multiple pleural biopsy samples were obtained in each patient and sent to the histopathology lab to obtain tissue diagnosis. All the data of the study were kept for critical analysis to reflect in the results and conclusion. Results The mean age of cases was 58 years with a male-female ratio of 1.25:1. Shortness of breath was the most common symptom (56 cases, 91.8%) followed by cough (47 cases, 77.04%). Hypertension was the most common comorbidity found among the cases (16 cases, 26.2%). The most common radiology finding was gross pleural effusion (54 cases, 88.5%), followed by mass lesion (16 cases, 26.2%), thickened pleura (16 cases, 26.2%), and nodules (nine cases, 14.8%). Pleural tissue biopsy revealed malignancy in 41 patients (67.2%). Out of which adenocarcinoma was the most common subtype (30 patients, 49.2%), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (eight patients, 13.1%), and was inconclusive in four patients. Post-thoracoscopic minor complications were reported in only 8 patients; 6 patients (9.8%) had subcutaneous emphysema, and two patients (3.3%) developed persistent air leak. Those were resolved with conservative treatment. Conclusion This study favored medical thoracoscopy as an ideal and effective tool to achieve a definitive diagnosis in recurrent exudative pleural effusion with very minimal and self-limited complications.

As the name suggests, SCAD is caused by the spontaneous formation of the false lumen within the coronary artery wall, thus compromising the blood flow to the myocardium. Unlike atherosclerotic acute coronary syndromes, SCAD is not directly associated with diabetes or hypertension; moreover, underlying connective tissue defects and inflammation are considered more contributory towards its etiology. Although its pathophysiology is not well understood, multiple theories have been proposed. Clinically, SCAD has a similar presentation to acute coronary syndromes, including substernal chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and T wave changes on the ECG. Due to its elusive etiology, variable clinical presentation, and potential for catastrophic outcomes, it is essential to make a proper diagnosis using tools such as coronary angiography, optical coherence tomographic imaging, intravascular ultrasound, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

Given its intrinsic properties, PDT represents an alluring way of stymieing the increasing surge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Despite favorable assets, various hurdles need to be circumvented before PDT can efficiently be used to combat AMR. Here, we have evaluated the possibility of generating aptamers equipped with ruthenium polypyridyl complexes against entire Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria. This combination is hypothesized to improve the poor specificity of photosensitizers, increase PDT efficiency, and potentially penetrate biofilms. Toward these aims, we first prepared nucleotides equipped with various ruthenium complexes and investigated their capacity at serving as substrates for polymerases for enzymatic DNA synthesis. Depending on the nature of the polypyridyl ligands, strong intercalation into dsDNA was observed even when connected to negatively charged nucleotide backbones. We then carried out SELEX and identified two unmodified aptamers that bound to the fixed bacterial target with Kd values of 118 nM and 541 nM. The SELEX experiment with the ruthenium-modified nucleotide led to the identification of one aptamer. The enzymatic synthesis of the modified aptamer was complicated by the formation of a very stable secondary structure confirmed by UV melting experiments (Tm of 84 \u00b0C). The modified aptamer displayed a high affinity (Kd value of 125 nM) for fixed Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria.

The gut-lung axis has been proven to be widely involved in sepsis-induced lung injury, yet effective interventions targeting gut microbiota homeostasis remain unknown. Single-cell sequencing revealed increased alveolar apoptosis and impaired macrophage efferocytosis during sepsis pathogenesis. Thus, we designed oral manganese-doped carbon dots (Mn-CDs) to alleviate septic lung injury by remodeling gut microbiota homeostasis and targeting the gut-lung axis. Biochemical characterization demonstrated Mn-CDs possess multienzyme mimetic activities (SOD-, CAT-, POD-, GPx-like) and potent ROS scavenging capacity. In murine sepsis models, Mn-CDs significantly improved systemic indices and were associated with macrophage anti-inflammatory states with enhanced efferocytosis, as evidenced by transcriptomic profiling. Integrated metagenomic/metabolomic analyses identified Mn-CDs-mediated enrichment of g_Clostridium and g_Bacteroides, concomitant with elevated indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) production. Subsequent in vitro studies demonstrate that IPA likely binds primarily to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), promoting both efferocytosis and anti-inflammatory polarization in macrophages, thereby mitigating septic lung injury. Notably, the fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from Mn-CDs-treated mice not only alleviated systemic symptoms but also effectively promoted efferocytic polarization of pulmonary macrophages in septic mice.

This review evaluates the emerging role of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), in improving the diagnostic landscape of SSc-PAH. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Embase and Google Scholar to identify studies involving AI applications in SSc, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and their intersection. Evidence indicates that AI models can assist interpretation across modalities, including heart sounds, ECGs, chest X-rays (CXRs), ECHOs, CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), and omics-based biomarkers. While several models show encouraging diagnostic performance, their accuracy varies by dataset and modality, and most require external validation against right heart catheterization (RHC)-confirmed cohorts.

We report the case of a female patient with Poland syndrome, a congenital anomaly involving chest wall deformities, who underwent left-sided breast reconstruction with an implant. She presented with implant rupture and capsular contracture, necessitating surgical removal of the implant and surrounding capsule. A total capsulectomy was performed, and reconstruction utilized the \"no-touch\" technique to reduce contamination. Intraoperative abnormalities of the periprosthetic capsule led to its submission for pathological analysis. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies confirmed EBV-positive DLBCL. A PET/CT scan showed no hypermetabolic activity or extramammary involvement.

{"id": "41172931", "text": "Bovine brucellosis, caused by Brucella abortus, is a zoonotic disease that leads to abortions in cattle and poses a public health risk. Vaccination with live attenuated strains, including S19 and RB51, is part of control programs. Both vaccines are recommended in calves, and RB51 is used for adult cattle in endemic herds due to its lack of interference with serological diagnosis. Experimental studies suggest prior S19 vaccination may protect against abortion following RB51 administration during gestation. Here, we report a case of abortion in a dairy cow, sero-negative to Brucella diagnostic assays, previously vaccinated with S19 as a calf and subsequently immunized with RB51 during the first trimester of pregnancy. The cow belongs to a herd infected with B. abortus five years ago, where a plan for eradication of brucellosis is being implemented. The abortion occurred at seven months of gestation, five months after RB51 immunization. Necropsy and histopathology of the fetus revealed systemic lesions consistent with brucellosis. Brucella was isolated from fetal lung and abomasal fluid, and PCR confirmed the isolate as RB51. Serological tests performed on the cow were negative, highlighting the diagnostic limitations in RB51-vaccinated animals. This case represents the first documented abortion caused by RB51 in a cow previously immunized with S19. These findings support the recommendation to avoid RB51 vaccination in pregnant cows to prevent abortion and potential zoonotic transmission.", "source": "PubMed"}

Methods: A total of 180 pneumoconiosis patients with different stages diagnosed in Guangzhou Twelfth People's Hospital from January 2022 to May 2023 were selected as the research objects by systematic sampling method, and their HRCT and DR examinations were performed. The display of lung imaging features of patients with pneumoconiosis by the two examination methods was analyzed, and the chi-square test and rank sum test were used to compare the differences in diagnostic staging results and the detection of pulmonary complications. Results: Among the patients with pneumoconiosis, there were 174 males and 6 females, with an age of (53.11\u00b112.22) years old and a working age of (14.94\u00b111.43) years. The number of lung areas with category 0 small opacity profusion in the HRCT images of patients was less than that in the DR images, and the number of lung areas with category 1 small opacity profusion was more than that in the DR images (P<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of lung areas with category 2 and category 3 small opacity profusion detected by the two images (P>0.05). The distribution of diagnostic differences between HRCT and DR images for the staging of pneumoconiosis was statistically significant (P<0.05), and the detection rates of HRCT for pneumoconiosis complicated with pulmonary tuberculosis, pneumonia, atelectasis, lymph node tumefaction, and pleural thickening were all higher than those of DR (P<0.05) . Conclusion: In the diagnosis of pneumoconiosis, HRCT has advantages over DR images in showing the fine structure of the lungs, determining the degree and extent of lesions.

{"id": "41175322", "text": "For people living with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), the journey to diagnosis can be long and complicated. EGPA is a rare inflammatory disorder, typically characterized by high levels of blood eosinophils and vasculitis in the lungs and/or other end organ(s). It is associated with asthma, pulmonary infiltrates, neuropathy, sinus disease and the presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Patients can present with a number of symptoms and complications, which often go unrecognized or misdiagnosed and can result in considerable delays in appropriate treatment and worsening of underlying disease. Following correct diagnosis, patients are often treated with oral corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs. While these treatments can be effective at controlling disease, they are also associated with significant side effects, which can lead to diminished quality of life. The emergence in recent years of anti-interleukin-5/receptor (anti-IL-5/R) therapies, such as benralizumab and mepolizumab, has revolutionized the management of EGPA. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a key cytokine in the maturation, proliferation and activation of eosinophils. Anti-IL-5/R therapies work by binding IL-5 or the receptor for IL-5, thereby significantly decreasing eosinophilic inflammation, the key pathogenic driver in EPGA. Not only are anti-IL-5/R therapies effective at controlling disease, but they are also well tolerated and can facilitate corticosteroid tapering. In this podcast, a patient and physician discuss the lived experience of EGPA, including difficulties with diagnosis, impact of disease on daily life and disease management with both traditional treatments and with the newer anti-IL-5/R therapies. The discussion highlights the importance of EGPA awareness and of physicians recognizing seemingly unconnected symptoms and different disease components, as well as the need to minimize corticosteroid use because of long-term risks. Furthermore, access to an experienced and coordinated healthcare team and establishing a strong support network are emphasized as essential to help patients manage this complex and rare disease.

The heterogeneity complicates clinical and radiological differentiation.This review presents the typical radiological patterns of pulmonary sarcoidosis, evaluates diagnostic modalities, and highlights the importance for prognosis and therapy of distinguishing between reversible and irreversible lesions.A comprehensive literature search focused on recent publications and guidelines, emphasizing imaging techniques and clinically relevant correlations.Conventional chest radiography using Scadding criteria provides a simple and cost-effective method of stage classification, but it also has limitations in terms of accuracy and in correlation with lung function. Computed tomography (CT) is the most precise imaging modality, showing characteristic features such as symmetrical hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, multiple micro- and macronodules with confluent consolidations, and upper lobe predominance. Advanced stages reveal fibrotic remodeling with linear opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and prognostically relevant honeycombing. Complications include pulmonary hypertension, venous compressions, and secondary fungal infections. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used primarily for cardiac sarcoidosis detection, while positron emission tomography (PET) can better assess inflammatory activity and therapy monitoring. Differential diagnosis with regard to other granulomatous, infectious, and neoplastic diseases is essential, and it requires an interdisciplinary approach.Pulmonary sarcoidosis requires a multimodal diagnostic approach, with CT playing a central role in staging and prognosis. Differentiation between reversible and fibrotic lesions is critical for therapeutic decisions.

{"id": "40688848", "text": "Background Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health issue despite being treatable and preventable. Early diagnosis and effective treatment are crucial for reducing TB transmission, in line with global control strategies. Chest X-rays, widely accessible and rapid, are key imaging tools for diagnosing TB. This retrospective study sought to assess chest X-ray findings of patients with confirmed tuberculosis in Ghana. Methods This study retrospectively analyzed chest X-ray findings to characterize lung lesions and assess tissue damage in 131 patients with bacteriologically confirmed TB. Lung lesions were categorized based on parenchymal changes, lesion extent, location, and pleural involvement. Results Reticulonodular infiltrates were observed in 66.4% (n=87) of patients, consolidation/ground-glass opacities in 58.8% (n=77), reticular infiltrates in 45.0% (n=59), and cavities in 42.0% (n=55). Pleural effusions were noted in 31.3% (n=41), predominantly unilateral (24.4%, n=32).\u00a0Parenchymal anomalies primarily affected the apical/upper lung zones, mostly on the left (70.2%, n=92). Both middle-zone (48.1%, n=63) and lower-zone (49.6%, n=65) abnormalities predominantly affected the right lung. The extent of lung involvement varied: 23.6% (n=31) had small (one zone), 11.4% (n=15) medium (two zones), and 58.0% (n=76) large (more than two zones) involvement.

{"id": "41216065", "text": "The epiglottis separates the pharynx from the larynx by flipping upward to prevent swallowed material from entering the airway. Cervical vertebral osteophytes can interfere with this movement, potentially leading to dysphagia. Videofluoroscopic (VF) and videoendoscopic (VE) examinations of swallowing are valuable tools for understanding the pathophysiology of dysphagia and for formulating appropriate rehabilitation plans. A 77-year-old man with pre-existing dysphagia for solid foods was hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). He stabilized with antiviral and supportive therapy but developed aspiration pneumonia on the sixth day of hospitalization. Rehabilitation therapy was initiated on day 7. Upon admission, the patient was kept fasting, and a VF\u00a0swallowing study was performed. This revealed cervical vertebral osteophytes at the C3/4 and C4/5 levels that impeded epiglottic inversion and hindered bolus passage through the pyriform sinus. It was considered that dysphagia became apparent following COVID-19 infection, leading to aspiration pneumonia. Surgery was not performed, and progressive feeding training was initiated. Under VE\u00a0evaluation, compensatory swallowing strategies were explored. Pharyngeal residue was reduced by adopting a forward-leaning posture and performing chin-down maneuvers. Alternating swallows of unthickened liquids further minimized pharyngeal residue, which the patient could expel independently. By combining the forward-leaning and chin-down postures, alternating swallows of unthickened liquids, and self-expulsion after swallowing, the patient successfully resumed oral intake of three regular meals and was discharged home. The primary cause of dysphagia in this case was presumed to be cervical vertebral osteophytes, with symptoms becoming apparent following COVID-19 infection. It is important to recognize that dysphagia can arise from cervical spine deformities even in the absence of neurological abnormalities. In this patient, compensatory swallowing techniques such as the forward-leaning posture and chin-down position promoted favorable deformation of the pharyngeal cavity and reduced pharyngeal residue. This case underscores the importance of identifying the underlying cause of dysphagia and implementing appropriate risk mitigation strategies.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41137733", "text": "Genetic risk scores (GRS) are crucial tools for estimating an individual's genetic liability to various traits and diseases, computed as a weighted sum of trait-associated allele counts. Traditionally, GRS models assume additive, linear effects of risk variants. However, complex traits often involve nonadditive interactions, such as epistasis, which are not captured by these conventional methods. In this study, we investigate the use of random forest (RF) models as a model-free approach for constructing GRS, leveraging RF's capacity to capture complex, nonlinear interactions among genetic variants. Specifically, we introduce two new RF-based GRS strategies to boost RF performance and to incorporate base data information if available, including (1) ctRF, which optimizes linkage disequilibrium (LD) clumping and p-value thresholds within RF; and (2) wRF, which adjusts the chance of SNP inclusion in tree nodes based on their association strength. Through simulation studies and real data applications of Alzheimer's disease, body mass index, and atopy, we find that ctRF consistently outperforms other RF-based methods and classical additive models when traits exhibit complex genetic architectures. Additionally, incorporating informative base data into RF-GRS construction can enhance predictive accuracy. Our findings suggest that RF-based GRS can effectively capture intricate genetic interactions, and offer a robust alternative to traditional GRS methods, especially for complex traits with nonlinear genetic effects.", "source": "PubMed"}

A retrospective medical records review was conducted for angioedema/HAE codes. Thirty-one patients with HAE-nl-C1INH were identified (female, 87.1%; mean age, 46.2 years; range, 16-74 years). All patients had experienced recurrent angioedema, with documentation of antihistamine and/or mast cell-targeted therapy ineffectiveness and normal/near-normal laboratory data. Genetic testing (n = 9) found no known pathogenic variants of HAE.

{"id": "41198824", "text": "The recommended chest compression site during pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is based on studies that did not account for dynamic respiratory changes in cardiac position. Since cardiac position changes with respiratory phase, the optimal site during CPR without respiratory support, which physiologically corresponds to the end-expiration state, may differ. We assessed heart position at end-expiration using echocardiography. A prospective observational study was conducted in 18 children under 7 years of age. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to identify the position of the left ventricle during both inspiration and expiration. Each subject underwent five measurements in each respiratory phase. The position of the left ventricle was recorded relative to the inter-nipple line and categorized by intercostal space (ICS). At end-expiration, the left ventricle was commonly located at the first upper ICS (53.3%) and nipple line (27.8%), with only 4.4% located at the first lower ICS and none below that level. During inspiration, the left ventricle was located at the first lower ICS (50.0%) and nipple line (35.6%). Linear mixed-effects regression demonstrated a significant upward shift in heart position during expiration compared to inspiration (\u03b2 = -1.46; 95% CI, -1.91 to -1.00; p\u2009<\u20090.001), independent of age, sex, and weight. These findings confirm that respiratory phase affects heart position in young children, with expiration associated with consistent cephalad shift. Therefore, the optimal chest compression site during pediatric CPR without respiratory support may be more cephalad than current guideline recommendations, suggesting the need to re-evaluate traditional landmarks in light of physiologic cardiac motion.", "source": "PubMed"}

Methods Chest radiographs from 1,470 patients, obtained from a public healthcare institution, were analyzed for nine pulmonary conditions: consolidation, heart enlargement, interstitial markers, linear atelectasis, no cardiopulmonary findings, nodule, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and tuberculosis. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and F1 scores were calculated for Oxipit ChestEye\u2122 and compared with radiologists' diagnoses, which served as the reference standard. Results The AI tool demonstrated accuracy ranging from 0.79 to 1.00 across the nine conditions evaluated. Sensitivity ranged from 0.25 to 1.00, and specificity ranged from 0.65 to 1.00. In differentiating between \"Normal\" and \"Altered\" categories, the AI model achieved an accuracy of 0.78. The F1 score for \"Normal\" was 0.86, whereas for \"Altered,\" it was 0.52.

We aimed to study the robustness and longevity of vaccine-induced virus-specific cellular immune responses in INR.METHODSVirus-specific CD8+ T cell responses were analyzed in INR (CD4+ T cell count < 300 cells/\u03bcL) and immunological responders (IR) (CD4+ T cell count > 500 cells/\u03bcL), receiving ART, and HIV-uninfected controls following COVID-19 mRNA vaccination and infection. Virus-specific CD8+ T cells were characterized using peptide-loaded MHC I tetramer technology, after in vitro expansion and cytokine production assays. Virus-specific CD4+ T cells and IgG levels were determined by activation-induced marker (AIM) assay and ELISA, respectively.RESULTSWe demonstrated that, while long-lasting virus-specific cellular immune responses were generated in INR, CD8+ T cell immunity remained limited compared with robust CD4+ T cell reactivity. CD8+ T cell responses in INR exhibited reduced breadth and frequency, accompanied by altered memory differentiation and suboptimal activation and effector response upon antigen exposure. This deficiency correlated with low CD4+ T cell counts, independent of other disease markers, highlighting the pivotal role of CD4+ T cells in orchestrating vaccine-induced immunity.

{"id": "41152259", "text": "Lung cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases in the world and early detection is critical to enhancing survival rates. With traditional diagnostic techniques - CT scans and chest X-rays - an invasive procedure must be performed and, in some cases, it relies on expert interpretation. Whether benign or malignant, the similarities in visual characteristics of nodules leads to ambiguity and makes for a difficult case which calls for the development of automatic lung cancer classification framework such as the one we proposed, which incorporates Deep Learning (DL) methods and uses a rigourous training methodology on top of that. Our framework pre-processes the images with adaptive filters to eliminate noise, segments lesions, removes, and refines features with Hybrid Horse Herd Optimization (HHO) and Lion Optimization Algorithm (LOA). Those features are classified with a hybrid Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory (DCNN\u2009+\u2009LSTM) model, which jointly enhances features extraction and temporal learning. We run data learning against standard lung CT datasets and achieved a score of 98.75% accuracy, demonstrating the proposed system is effective in classifying normal lung tissue from abnormal. Nonetheless, the real-time usability of the system is limited by the performance of the CT, and the computational demands of the model, which can be troublesome for clinical situations that typically possess less computational power. Furthermore, these limitations never the less provide a more intelligent, accurate diagnostic aid for radiologists that non-invasively assists in clinical decision making and, importantly, earlier cancer diagnoses.", "source": "PubMed"}

Pediatric cases are sporadic, and anesthetic management poses significant challenges due to airway hypersensitivity, allergy risk, and systemic complications. We describe the anesthetic management of a six-year-old girl with EGPA presenting with left-sided hemiparesis secondary to a prior intracerebral bleed, severe eosinophilia, and left lung collapse with pleural effusion. She was scheduled for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and pleural biopsy for persistent hypereosinophilia to confirm the probable diagnosis of EGPA. Considering her history of vasculitis, stroke, bronchial hyperreactivity, hypereosinophilia, and elevated IgE, the anesthetic plan prioritized avoidance of known allergenic agents such as neuromuscular blockers, opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and latex. General anesthesia was induced with propofol and sevoflurane. Although one-lung ventilation is often required, endotracheal intubation becomes a must, and it predisposes to pulmonary complications in such cases. A discussion with the surgical team was held to explore the use of both lung ventilation with low tidal volume and a supraglottic airway (i-gel\u00ae, Intersurgical Ltd, Berkshire, UK) to overcome the issues. Ultrasound-guided erector spinae block was administered as part of multimodal pain management. The procedure was limited to thoracoscopic biopsy as the need for further decortication was ruled out and was uneventful, and the patient had a stable recovery. This case underscores the importance of tailored anesthetic planning in pediatric EGPA patients with multisystem involvement. A multidisciplinary, individualized approach addressing hypersensitivity might ensure safe perioperative outcomes, even in complex cases involving the central nervous and respiratory systems.", "source": "PubMed"}

Because of their non-specific imaging features, such lesions are often mistaken for benign tumors, leading to diagnostic errors. This report describes the case of a 69-year-old woman who presented with chest tightness and had a history of gluteal MLPS. Multimodal imaging (CT, ultrasound, MRI) revealed a pericardial mass. Although features such as well-circumscribed margins and delayed contrast filling suggested a benign-appearing lesion rather than enabling a definitive diagnosis, the clinical history of the patient strongly favored metastatic MLPS. Imaging alone could not provide a definitive diagnosis, highlighting the challenge posed by overlapping features between benign and malignant cardiac masses. The final diagnosis relied on histopathology and molecular testing. Postoperative immunohistochemistry revealed a spindle cell tumor with myxoid stroma (S-100 negative, MDM2 weakly positive). Molecular pathology confirmed the diagnosis by detecting the FUS-DDIT3 fusion gene, establishing metastatic MLPS. This case underscores the critical limitations of imaging in reaching a definitive diagnosis and emphasizes that accurate classification necessitates integration with histopathological and molecular analyses. An optimized diagnostic strategy should incorporate a comprehensive review of clinical history-especially any prior sarcoma-maintain heightened vigilance for overlapping imaging features of rare sarcomas in atypical locations, and include molecular pathology to effectively prevent misdiagnosis.", "source": "PubMed"}

Our prospective study from a TB-endemic setting (India) recruited 541 predominantly HIV-negative participants with presumed TB. This is the largest cohort to date assessing LUS, FASH, and additional ultrasound findings for TB diagnosis. Our study demonstrates that no single ultrasound finding alone, or even in combination, reaches the accuracy targets of the target product profile for a facility-based screening test (triage) proposed by WHO. FASH accuracy in our study aligned with previously reported data in HIV-negative participants but was less specific in HIV-positive participants.

In summary, this study demonstrates accuracy of ultrasound for TB diagnosis, backed by a robust study design and using a comprehensive reference standard and CXR comparator for LUS. Modelling suggests that an algorithmic approach combining ultrasound and clinical findings may be of highest value to inform risk of TB and guide further testing to confirm the diagnosis of TB.

Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted for a period of one year. A total of 186 non-duplicate Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) isolates from various samples were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing. Phenotypic detection of carbapenemase production was performed using the modified Hodge test (MHT), modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM), and combined disc testing (CDT). Genotypic analysis using PCR was performed on 20 representative CR-Kp isolates to detect blaNDM, blaKPC, blaOXA-48, blaIMP, and blaVIM genes. Results Out of 186 K. pneumoniae isolates, 120 (64.52%) were carbapenem-resistant based on Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Respiratory and bloodstream infections showed the highest CR-Kp prevalence. Phenotypic methods detected carbapenemase activity in 61.29% (combined disk test), 48.92% (mCIM), and 40.86% (MHT) in K. pneumoniae\u00a0isolates.

Their simultaneous occurrence suggests an aggressive disease course and presents substantial diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Because symptoms are often nonspecific, diagnosis is frequently delayed, which can lead to worse outcomes. Early recognition through timely imaging and a coordinated multidisciplinary approach are essential for optimizing clinical results. CASE REPORT A 65-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus presented with a 1-week history of epigastric pain, fever, and constipation. Laboratory studies showed leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers. Chest radiography showed an opacity in the left lower lung field. Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated a focal aneurysmal dilatation of the descending thoracic aorta measuring 8.0\u00d77.1\u00d75.0 cm with an irregular wall and surrounding fat stranding, consistent with a mycotic aneurysm, and a hypodense hepatic lesion with peripheral enhancement, suggestive of a liver abscess. Empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin was initiated. Given the patient's and family's preference, comorbidities, and high surgical risk, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was selected as the primary intervention. Blood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae sensitive to piperacillin-tazobactam, prompting discontinuation of vancomycin. She improved steadily and was discharged after 40 days.

Although not yet approved for functional testing, MRI with the hepatocyte-specific contrast agent gadolinium provides a\u00a0practicable surrogate parameter for parallel three-dimensional (tumor) imaging. This procedure is already well validated. In the future, deep learning algorithms will enable automated analyses of segmental liver function; however, surgical expertise remains decisive for assessing resectability. As a\u00a0guideline the rule of thumb is at least 30% parenchymal reserve in patients with a healthy liver and 40% in risk constellations. This article provides an overview of current concepts and diagnostic procedures for the preoperative assessment of sufficient parenchymal reserve.", "source": "PubMed"}

Even after completing a full course of anti-tubercular therapy (ATT), persistent intraocular inflammation may drive delayed recurrences of CME, highlighting the need for vigilant, escalation-based management. We report a case of a 31-year-old Indonesian woman who presented with sudden-onset hand motion vision in her left eye. Fundus examination was obscured by dense vitreous hemorrhage, and B-scan ultrasonography confirmed an attached retina. Diagnostic workup revealed a positive interferon-\u03b3 release assay and apical infiltrates on chest radiography, with no alternative etiology, supporting a diagnosis of presumed TRV. The patient was treated with a standard nine-month course of ATT and tapering oral corticosteroids. Due to progressive retinal ischemia, pan-retinal photocoagulation was performed. Recurrent vitreous hemorrhages and persistent CME necessitated a posterior sub-Tenon triamcinolone injection and 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser at month 9. Fifteen months postoperatively, best-corrected visual acuity had improved to 20/20, with complete CME resolution. The purpose of this case report is to describe the management of TRV through a progressive escalation of therapy and to outline practical treatment considerations for clinicians working in tuberculosis (TB)-endemic regions.\u00a0This case also illustrates that early ATT alone may be insufficient to prevent structural complications in TRV. A stepwise, multimodal approach combining systemic therapy, laser photocoagulation, periocular corticosteroids, and timely vitrectomy can restore excellent vision and reduce the risk of recurrent CME. Clinicians managing patients in TB-endemic areas should maintain close optical coherence tomography (OCT)-guided monitoring of CME and be prepared to escalate treatment promptly to prevent irreversible visual loss.", "source": "PubMed"}

In swine, dietary Se supplementation enhances immunity and growth, and previous studies suggest it protects immune cells during viral infection. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes severe respiratory and reproductive failure in swine, resulting in annual losses of 1.2 billion USD. Vaccine efficacy is hampered by the virus's high mutation rate, requiring alternative approaches. This study examines the effects of organic (DL-Selenomethionine, L-Selenomethionine, yeast-selenium) and inorganic (sodium selenite) Se on PRRSV infection in vitro. Porcine alveolar macrophages, the primary target of PRRSV in the lung, were isolated from healthy animals and infected with PRRSV-2 with or without Se. Mitochondrial function, gene expression, oxidative stress, and viral load were assessed post-infection. DL-selenomethionine showed increased glycolytic and mitochondrial ATP production relative to other compounds, suggesting improved mitochondrial function. No antiviral activity against PRRSV was observed. Transcriptome analysis revealed infection-driven modulation, with upregulation of IL6, IL8, IL1B1, MX1, and TXNRD1, but Se had no significant effect.

The KA bacteriophage exhibits an icosahedral morphology with a short non-contractile tail, and its genome comprises 49,319 base pairs encoding 54 proteins. Notably, it lacks genes associated with lysogeny, virulence, or antibiotic resistance. It is classified within the Autographiviridae family, Slopekvirinae sub-family, and Drulisvirus genus, and represents a novel species with less than 95\u00a0% sequence similarity to previously identified phages in the NCBI database. The KA phage maintained stability between -4 and 40\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 4-8, with an optimal multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, a latent period of 40\u00a0min, and a burst size of 80 plaque forming units (PFU) per infected cell. The presence of calcium chloride and magnesium chloride reduced the adsorption time of the KA phage.

In June 2022, seven golden monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) developed flu-like symptoms in succession at a zoo in Jiangsu Province, China, with two succumbing to respiratory distress. Histopathological and immunostaining results supported a diagnosis of pulmonary infection with IAV, and a novel H3N2 canine/human reassortant virus, designated A/golden monkey/Jiangsu/1/2022 (Gm-1), was isolated from the lungs of deceased animals. Genomic sequencing revealed that the PB1 gene of Gm-1 exhibited >\u202f97\u202f% identity with human strains, while the remaining 7 segments originated from early local canine H3N2 virus (A/canine/Jiangsu/06/2010, JS06).

Among the DRT family, DRT2, DRT3, and DRT9 systems employ protein-noncoding RNA (ncRNA) co-regulatory mechanisms to execute defense functions. Here, we focus on the DRT2 system from Klebsiella pneumoniae, which consists of a reverse transcriptase (RT) and an essential ncRNA component. Using biochemical and structural approaches, we determine the structure of the DRT2 system and reveal detailed interaction modes between the DRT2-RT protein and the ncRNA, especially mediated by specialized anchoring loops and pseudoknot-related structures. The RT protein adopts a conventional \"right-hand\" fold, while a flexible region of the ncRNA exhibits dynamic conformations, likely serving as the template for reverse transcription. DRT2 mediates reverse transcription through a conserved DDD catalytic triad that coordinates a divalent Mg\u00b2\u207a ion. Notably, a short DNA primer-ncRNA duplex is accommodated in a positively charged pocket formed by the thumb and fingers domains, and both interaction analysis and mutagenesis studies confirm that duplex stabilization is essential for activity. Structural comparison and phylogenetic studies of DRT2 and other RT proteins, such as group II introns and UG/Abi RTs, highlight the unique adaptation with a straight extended thumb domain and specialized structures for ncRNA-binding, exemplifying an evolutionary trajectory of RT proteins.

Developing computer-aided diagnosis tools that determine infection severity can aid healthcare professionals in deciding treatment strategies and preventing cross-infection. In such manner, lung infection severity classification from chest CTs is crucial for deciding treatment plans and interventions needed to block illness progression in individual patients and reduce cross infection. However, current techniques face performance, generalizability, and explainability challenges for automated infection severity classification methods due to the high spatial complexity of 3D volumes. Significant efforts have been focused on segmentation approaches to quantify lung infection and assess infection severity, but such segmentation methods require expensive data annotation and clinical expertise. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised classification approach to distinguish between different levels of infection, while providing clinicians with explainable results. To mimic clinical practice, the different stages in our approach focus on low-level infection patterns as well as high-level infection coverage in lung CT scans. We then fuse the high-level features with the positionally encoded low-level features to provide volume-level infection classification. Testing on the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) multi-centre multi-region datasets, our approach shows promising performance gains compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, where we achieve state-of-the-art severity classification performance.

Simultaneously, opportunistic fungal infections such as mucormycosis have been increasingly reported, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Triazole antifungals are widely used to treat such infections, but their potential immunomodulatory effects remain underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the off-target potential of commonly used antifungal triazoles itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole against human phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4), a key enzyme involved in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly propose and computationally validate the dual role of triazole antifungals as both antifungal and immunomodulatory agents. A computational approach comprising molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum chemical analysis was employed to evaluate the interaction of the selected triazoles with PDE-4. Binding affinity and interaction stability were compared with roflumilast, a known PDE-4 inhibitor. Among the tested triazoles, posaconazole exhibited the most favourable binding energy (-44.60\u2009kcal/mol via MM-GBSA), forming stable interactions with key residues in the catalytic site of PDE-4, similar to those observed with roflumilast. MD simulations further confirmed the binding stability of posaconazole, as evidenced by favourable RMSD and hydrogen bonding patterns. Quantum chemical analysis indicated strong electrophilicity and reactivity of posaconazole, supporting its potential PDE-4 inhibitory activity. The findings suggest that certain triazole antifungals, especially posaconazole, may both fight fungal infections and reduce the cytokine storm in severe COVID-19, offering a promising rapid-response therapeutic strategy.", "source": "PubMed"}

Pulmonary sequelae are particularly common, which significantly impair patients' quality of life. The mechanisms underlying post-COVID-19 pulmonary sequelae are complex and multifactorial, and their management is still at an exploratory stage. This review explores the manifestations, underlying mechanisms, and potential treatment approaches for post-COVID-19 pulmonary sequelae. Fatigue, dyspnea, myalgia, and sleep disturbances are the most commonly reported symptoms following COVID-19 infection, while anxiety and depression are also prevalent. Respiratory symptoms include dyspnoea, persistent cough, hypoxia, and reduced exercise capacity. Impaired lung diffusion capacity is the most frequently observed pulmonary function abnormality, and residual abnormalities on chest computed tomography (CT) commonly include ground-glass opacities (GGO) and fibrotic-like changes. Air trapping is also an important CT finding and has been reported to associated with impaired lung diffusion function. The potential mechanisms may include pulmonary fibrosis, chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, coagulation abnormalities and thrombosis, and persistent viral infection.

Granulomas, caseous necrosis, abscesses, fibrous proliferation, collagen degeneration, and granulation tissue formation did not show significant differences between the two groups. We further compared infiltrating immune cells and found that the numbers of T cells, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages were significantly higher in the STB group than those in the PTB group, but there was no statistical difference compared to normal spleen tissue, suggesting that tuberculosis infection may not have a significant impact on the immune response in STB cases. The number of PD-L1+ immune cells in the STB group was significantly higher than that in the PTB group and normal spleen tissue, while the number of PD-1+ immune cells did not differ significantly among the three groups. In summary, STB has unique pathological features and immune microenvironment, with a higher incidence of coagulative necrosis and an extreme immune suppression state.", "source": "PubMed"}

We extracted comprehensive data on vaccine candidates through the Pharmcube system as of March 21, 2025, to analyze the latest trends and disparities in the research and development (R&D) landscape for infectious disease vaccines since 2015. The global vaccine R&D landscape comprises 919 candidates. The top three diseases targeted for vaccine R&D are COVID-19 (245 candidates), influenza (118 candidates), and HIV (68 candidates). Among these, 25% (231 candidates) are nucleic acid vaccines, followed by recombinant protein vaccines (125 candidates) and viral vector vaccines (73 candidates). More than 50% of the candidates are in the pre-phase II stage, while nearly 15% are in phase II (144 candidates) or phase III (137 candidates). Of the 36 countries or territories reporting vaccine candidates, China leads with 313 candidates, followed by the USA with 276 candidates and the UK with 63 candidates. The majority of the candidates are being developed independently or collaboratively by private companies/industry in China (289 candidates), France (30 candidates), the Republic of Korea (27 candidates), Germany (26 candidates), the USA (217 candidates), and the UK (43 candidates). The USA, France, and the Republic of Korea mainly predominantly develop mRNA vaccines, while China primarily develops recombinant protein vaccines, and the UK focuses on viral vector vaccines.

Few studies have examined the heterogeneity of clinical characteristics in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients with BSIs. We used machine learning (ML) to identify clinically distinct subtypes in SOT and non-SOT BSI patients. We applied unsupervised ML to clinical variables collected within 48 hours of index BSI diagnosis, clustering 15,550 patients from a major medical center in Houston, Texas. Using k-means++, we identified three major subtypes (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3). Patients in cluster \u03b1 were older, predominantly male, and required more vasopressor and ventilator support compared to other clusters. SOT patients in cluster \u03b1 included more liver and lung transplant recipients and developed BSI closer to the transplant date (165 days, p<0.01). Propensity score matching was applied to compare the mortality in SOT and non-SOT groups. Although SOT patients exhibited higher rates of drug-resistant pathogens, SOT patients had a lower 30-day mortality compared with non-SOT patients overall (9.0% vs. 12.8%, p=0.01), driven by cluster \u03b1 specifically (18.3% vs. 33.1%, p<0.01).

This study was designed to explore the protective effect and mechanism of rhIFN-\u03b11b on lung injury in mice infected with influenza A virus (H1N1). The lung-adapted strain of influenza A virus NYMCX-179\u00a0A was inoculated into mice via intranasal infection, followed by administration of rhIFN-\u03b11b. Mouse lung tissues exhibited significant inflammatory damage, enhanced HA expression, and distinct distribution of viral particles (observed by TEM). Administration of rhIFN-\u03b11b or oseltamivir reduced mouse mortality, alleviated lung tissue inflammation, downregulated HA expression, decreased H1 mRNA levels, and attenuated the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, the in vivo protective effect of rhIFN-\u03b11b administered via nebulization was stronger than that of intramuscular injection. In vitro, rhIFN-\u03b11b reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion, diminished HA protein and H1 mRNA levels, and inhibited apoptosis in H1N1 virus-infected MDCK cells. Mechanistically, rhIFN-\u03b11b increased the protein levels of phosphorylated JAK2 (p-JAK2) and phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) in both H1N1 virus-infected MDCK cells and lung tissues from mice with lung injury. Additionally, treatment with AG490-a JAK/STAT signaling inhibitor-reversed the effects of rhIFN-\u03b11b on HA expression, inflammatory cytokine secretion, and cell apoptosis in H1N1 virus-infected MDCK cells. These findings demonstrated that rhIFN-\u03b11b ameliorates lung tissue damage in H influenza A virus (H1N1)-infected mice, with the protective effect of nebulized rhIFN-\u03b11b being stronger than that of intramuscularly administered rhIFN-\u03b11b. Furthermore, the protective effect of rhIFN-\u03b11b is associated with the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.", "source": "PubMed"}

He developed pancytopenia requiring granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. Bone marrow aspiration and trephine revealed hemophagocytosis, with markedly elevated serum ferritin levels and a negative autoimmune workup apart from a positive anti-Ro antibody.\u00a0The diagnosis of acquired HLH was established in the patient. Latent tuberculosis (TB) was treated empirically,\u00a0and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected parvovirus B19. He was managed with high-dose dexamethasone after a hematology consultation and received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). A few years later, in 2022, the patient was readmitted with acute respiratory distress and bilateral pulmonary consolidations. He was diagnosed with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) and\u00a0secondary HLH.

The first episode was likely to be triggered by the latent TB\u00a0and parvovirus infection, and the second one by the AOSD. Both episodes were treated with anakinra, showing that targeting specific immune system chemicals can help manage HLH. Clinicians should consider the possibility of HLH for patients who have low blood counts and widespread inflammation with an unclear cause, especially if they have known risk factors. Early recognition and prompt treatment with medicines that are targeted towards\u00a0the immune system can save lives.

We used a modelling tool developed for GBD, the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), to estimate cause-specific death rates for most causes. We computed YLLs as the product of the number of deaths for each cause-age-sex-location-year and the standard life expectancy at each age. Probability of death was calculated as the chance of dying from a given cause in a specific age period, for a specific population. Mean age at death was calculated by first assigning the midpoint age of each age group for every death, followed by computing the mean of all midpoint ages across all deaths attributed to a given cause. We used GBD death estimates to calculate the observed mean age at death and to model the expected mean age across causes, sexes, years, and locations. The expected mean age reflects the expected mean age at death for individuals within a population, based on global mortality rates and the population's age structure. Comparatively, the observed mean age represents the actual mean age at death, influenced by all factors unique to a location-specific population, including its age structure.

While ischaemic heart disease and stroke persist as leading causes of death, there has been progress in reducing their age-standardised mortality rates globally. Four other leading causes have also shown large declines in global age-standardised mortality rates across the study period: diarrhoeal diseases, tuberculosis, stomach cancer, and measles. Other causes of death showed disparate patterns between sexes, notably for deaths from conflict and terrorism in some locations. A large reduction in age-standardised rates of YLLs occurred for neonatal disorders. Despite this, neonatal disorders remained the leading cause of global YLLs over the period studied, except in 2021, when COVID-19 was temporarily the leading cause.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted using data from the National Tuberculosis Information System from 2000 to 2021. A total of 18,697 adult patients with DS-TB were included. Patients were grouped into three time periods: Period I (2000-2007), Period II (2008-2015), and Period III (2016-2021). Treatment outcomes were categorized as successful (treatment completed with recovery) or unsuccessful (patients who encountered treatment failure, died during treatment, or converted to drug-resistant tuberculosis). Associations with individual risk factors, including smoking, alcohol use, comorbidities, and sociodemographic variables, were analyzed. Results: Treatment success rates improved steadily across the study periods: 82.3% in Period I, 84.4% in Period II, and 87.6% in Period III. Mortality rates declined over time but remained substantial: 17.1%, 15.2%, and 12.0% in Periods I, II, and III, respectively. Non-lethal treatment failures decreased slightly (0.6%, 0.4%, and 0.4%). Multivariate analysis identified significant associations between treatment failure and multiple risk factors, including low BMI, male gender, unemployment, homelessness, smoking, alcohol and substance use, and comorbid conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, HIV, and renal failure. Conclusions: Treatment outcomes for DS-TB in Lithuania have improved over the past two decades; however, certain modifiable risk factors-such as low BMI, homelessness, substance use, and comorbidities-remain strongly linked to treatment failure. To further improve outcomes, targeted interventions such as nutritional support, housing programs, and integrated addiction services should be prioritized for high-risk groups within national TB control efforts.", "source": "PubMed"}

Results demonstrate that the ResNet50-based model with fuzzy integration achieves superior classification accuracy of 98.7%, sensitivity of 98.4%, and specificity of 98.8%, outperforming standard implementations of VGG16 (97.8% accuracy) and VGG19 (98.2% accuracy). The proposed approach shows particular strength in handling borderline cases where traditional CNN confidence falls below 75%, achieving 8.4% improvement in uncertain case classification. Statistical significance testing confirms meaningful performance gains (p\u2009<\u20090.05) across all architectures, with ResNet50 showing the most substantial enhancement (p\u2009=\u20090.0018). The fuzzy inference system activates an average of 8.4 rules per classification decision, providing transparent reasoning pathways that enhance clinical interpretability while maintaining real-time processing capability (0.23\u00a0s per image). This research contributes to advancing automated lung disease diagnosis systems with improved accuracy, uncertainty handling, and clinical interpretability for computer-aided diagnostic applications.", "source": "PubMed"}

Data from four controlled vaccination and challenge trials involving 41 calves were analysed. Animals were vaccinated with live BCG or heat-inactivated M. bovis via oral or parenteral routes, and immunologic and post-mortem analyses were conducted to evaluate vaccine performance. Compared with nonvaccinated controls, all vaccination strategies significantly reduced M. bovis bacterial loads in the lungs (up to 99%). However, bacterial loads in lymphoid tissues increased, confirming that tuberculosis is primarily a lymphatic disease. Diagnostic interference varied by vaccine type and administration route, with oral administration resulting in lower interference. Gross lesion scores were inconsistent across groups, suggesting limited utility as a measure of vaccine efficacy. Immune responses revealed increased detection of infection, particularly with inactivated vaccines.

Therefore, the present study investigated avian tuberculosis infection in several domestic pigeon's lofts in Markazi Province, Iran. Twelve pigeons from different suspected pigeon lofts were collected, fed properly, and kept under suitable conditions. After recording clinical manifestations, athe pigeons underwent radiographic imaging in lateral and ventrodorsal positions. Then, the pigeons were euthanized and subjected to necropsy examinations. During necropsy examinations, samples taken from any visible lesions. If no lesions were present, samples were taken from the liver and delivered to the tuberculosis reference laboratory for culturing in LJG, LJP, H, and HM culture media. Finally, the grown colonies were tested using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with the primers targeting 16S rRNA, IS1245, and IS901. The most prominent clinical manifestations in the infected pigeons were cachexia and articular swelling of the wings and legs, while the most common radiographic findings were periarticular inflammation and Renomegaly.

A Gastrografin study later ruled out perforation, and she was successfully extubated after two days without surgical intervention. One month later, she was readmitted with progressive dyspnea and wheezing, initially misdiagnosed as an asthma exacerbation. Her symptoms failed to improve with IV steroids, and a bedside fiberoptic exam by ENT revealed 85% SGS.

{"id": "41192081", "text": "The rising prevalence of drug-resistant bacterial infections poses a significant public health challenge. This is particularly evident in Klebsiella pneumoniae, a pathogen that can cause severe diseases including pneumonia, liver abscesses, sepsis, and death. Phage therapy, which involves the use of active phages or endolysins, is gaining attention as an alternative to antibiotics in the management of infections. A lytic bacteriophage (vB_KpP_HS37) targeting K. pneumoniae from sewage at Shanghai No.6 People's Hospital was isolated in this study. The phage exhibited robust activity across a temperature range of 4 to 50\u00a0\u00b0C and pH values from 5.0 to 10.0. Genome sequencing revealed that HS37 possesses a linear double-stranded DNA genome of 74,084 base pairs with a GC content of 45.13\u00a0%. It is a new species of the Sugarlandvirus genus, Demerecviridae family. The HS37 endolysin (Lys41) was successfully expressed in vitro and subsequently characterized. Notably, the lytic spectrum of Lys41 was wider compared to its parental phage, HS37. Lys41 exhibited optimal lytic activity within a temperature range of 37 to 55\u00a0\u00b0C and a pH range of 4.0 to 6.0. When combined with EDTA and KCl, Lys41 effectively lysed K. pneumoniae and showed a more extensive lytic spectrum than phage HS37. The combination of Lys41 and 15\u00a0ppm potassium sorbate achieved reductions of 1.6 and 0.9 Log10 CFU/mL in K. pneumoniae on lettuce and cooked chicken, respectively. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of phage HS37 and its endolysin Lys41 as a therapeutic agent against K. pneumoniae infections.", "source": "PubMed"}

Methods: A case-control study was conducted to collect patients with PVC from January 2021 to June 2023 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University. The study subjects were divided into a PVC high-load group (\u226520%) and a PVC low-load group (<20%) based on the level of PVC loading in the 24-hour Holter electrocardiography monitoring. The parameter characteristics of EAT were obtained from no-contrast chest CT images. Multivariate logistic regression model analysis was used to assess the factors associated with high PVC loading levels, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the predictive value of the model. Results: A total of 166 subjects were included in the study, including 50 in the PVC high-load group and 116 in the PVC low-load group. Compared with the PVC low-load group, EATV was significantly increased in the high-load group (Z=4.83, P<0.001), and EATA was significantly lower in the high-load group than in the low-load group (t=-3.95, P<0.001).

In cases of massive hemoptysis, the offending vessel originates from the bronchial artery in more than 90% of cases, and in a few cases, it can originate from nonbronchial arteries. Superselective embolization of complex or rarely affected vessels remains challenging. The SwiftNINJA\u00ae steerable microcatheter (SSM) (Merit Medical) optimizes the navigation of complex vessels through preset tip angles. We present a case of massive hemoptysis caused by lung cancer, in which the offending artery originated from the right thyrocervical trunk, which was at an acute angle (<30\u00b0) relative to the right subclavian artery. After conventional microcatheter techniques failed in superselection, the SSM was selected based on the anatomical characteristics of the bleeding vessel during the procedure. By setting the preset angle of its tip, we could quickly and accurately pass it through the right subclavian artery and hook its branch arteries, thereby easily superselecting and embolizing the bleeding vessel. Through the use of SSM, superselection and embolization of difficult angles can be successfully achieved. SSM improves the efficiency of superselective embolization in BAE surgery.", "source": "PubMed"}

From infancy to adulthood, FA impacts quality of life, mental health, social participation, and access to safe environments. These burdens are often compounded by limited emergency preparedness, lack of institutional support, and social stigma. Methods: This narrative review synthesizes disparities and barriers faced by individuals with FA across key life stages, including early childhood, elementary and middle school, high school, college, and the transition to the workplace. It also highlights evidence-based strategies and resources developed by a leading national center for food allergy and asthma research that address FA barriers throughout the lifespan. Results: Findings demonstrate that despite advances in FA innovation and treatment, disparities in education, preparedness, and accommodation persist. These inequities disproportionately affect underserved populations and environments where awareness and policy enforcement are limited.

Methods: We present the case of a 15-year-old adolescent with systemic lupus erythematosus, on immunosuppressive therapy, who is diagnosed with tuberculous meningoencephalitis presenting the clinical, diagnostic and imaging characteristics, as well as the diagnostic traps and limitations associated with this condition. Antituberculosis therapy was started empirically, because there was no improvement in the clinical status with conventional antibiotic therapy; the diagnosis was established 7 days after the start of the antituberculosis treatment, with the help of an acid-fast bacilli culture from the cerebrospinal fluid. Results: The course of the tuberculous meningoencephalitis was slowly favorable, despite the superimposed COVID-19 infection. Delay in administering immunosuppressive therapy led to the onset of renal and joint manifestations.

Streptococcus mutans and Porphyromonas gingivalis are key oral bacterial pathogens that cause highly prevalent dental diseases worldwide, such as dental caries and gingivitis. Our main objective for this study was to investigate the presence and prevalence of these oral bacteria in wastewater to determine the feasibility of using WBE for oral pathogens. We measured S. mutans and P. gingivalis nucleic acids in weekly samples for 24 months at a local wastewater treatment plant. Between June 2023 and May 2025, a weekly sample of untreated wastewater was collected, resulting in a total of 100 samples collected over the timespan. Samples were concentrated, extracted for DNA, and then tested for each bacterium. Our results showed that 89% and 58% were positive for S. mutans and P. gingivalis, respectively, which shows that wastewater surveillance is appropriate for oral bacteria. Average concentrations were 4.57 log10 genome copies/L and 3.03 log10 genome copies/L for S. mutans and P. gingivalis, respectively. Detections of oral bacteria were observed in the primary and final effluent, but concentrations were significantly lower in the final effluent than in the untreated wastewater. The high levels of oral bacteria in wastewater indicated a potential transmission mechanism for these bacteria through water, specifically for S. mutans. Additionally, this study underscores the unique potential for WBE to be used in the surveillance of oral bacterial pathogens.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41152908", "text": "Respiratory virus infections have been presenting significant global public health challenges. The virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal influenza largely relies on triggering abnormal host immune responses, particularly the production of a cytokine storm, which is notably increased in elderly patients. However, as the mechanisms underlying this age-associated exacerbation remain unclear, we investigated the role of the aging tissue microenvironment in promoting inflammation associated with viral infection. Our research, based on clinical samples, cellular experiments, and mouse models, provides evidence that the aging lung microenvironment induces severe inflammatory responses and leads to tissue damage, with senescent cells playing a crucial role in this process. Further mechanistic insights reveal that elevated levels of downstream inflammatory factors result from a significant and robust activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway. This increase is attributed to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in senescent cells and subsequent reduced expression of PDLIM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase regulating P65 degradation. Finally, restoring PDLIM2 significantly inhibits viral infection-mediated inflammatory responses and organ damage in the aging body. Therefore, this study offers a novel perspective by elucidating the molecular mechanism and exploring the therapeutic potential behind viral infection-related inflammatory responses, particularly the mechanism accelerating inflammatory storms in elderly patients post-infection.", "source": "PubMed"}

The evaluation is conducted on the IN-CXR tuberculosis dataset from ICMR-NIRT, which contains a comprehensive collection of CXR images of both normal and abnormal categories. The hybrid model achieves a binary classification accuracy of 86.39% and an ROC-AUC score of 93.79%, outperforming tested baseline models that rely exclusively on either CNNs or ViTs when trained on this dataset. Furthermore, the integration of Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) enhances the interpretability of the model's predictions.

Further analysis confirmed that S1 stabilized the HIF-1\u03b1 protein in a hypoxia-independent manner, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 restored synaptic gene expression, including GRIN2A, SHANK1, and JPH3. By 6 weeks post-injection, hippocampal neuronal loss was accompanied by the accumulation of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and aggregated \u03b1-synuclein. Notably, treatment with metformin rescued synaptic gene expression and attenuated p-tau and \u03b1-synuclein aggregation. These findings suggest that S1 disrupts synaptic homeostasis and promotes neurodegenerative processes, and that metformin may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate long-term cognitive sequelae of COVID-19.", "source": "PubMed"}

{"id": "41152687", "text": "Background: Beta-lactam allergy (BLA) labels are common in children but often disproven when formally evaluated. This diagnostic discrepancy leads to higher health-care costs and increased adverse outcomes. Beta-lactam antibiotics are associated with a variety of adverse reactions in children. A serum sickness-like reaction (SSLR) is one adverse reaction that is complex in its diagnosis and management due to its heterogeneous clinical presentation and poorly understood mechanism. This unclear presentation and diagnostic criteria can be confusing for patients, families, and health-care professionals, leading to allergy evaluation hesitancy. With updated drug practice parameters that support the utility of oral drug challenges for patients with SSLRs related to beta-lactams, barriers remain for these patients to seek allergy evaluation. Objectives: The objective was to assess caregiver perspectives on BLA delabeling and identify barriers to drug challenge testing in children with a history of SSLRs. Methods: We conducted an 18-question telephone survey with 14 caregivers of children with a history of beta-lactam-associated SSLR. The survey assessed attitudes toward allergy delabeling, understanding of challenge testing, and perceived barriers to testing. Results: Most caregivers demonstrated an understanding of the importance of allergy delabeling; however, the comfort level with challenge testing varied, depending on the setting, provider, and perceived risk of SSLR recurrence. Of the caregivers, 62.4% reported feeling comfortable with their child's pediatrician performing the testing. When asked about their concerns about testing, nearly 50% of caregivers expressed concern about the possibility of a repeated SSLR. Conclusion: The overall positive attitude toward BLA testing, especially in a primary care setting, highlights an opportunity to make testing more accessible for patients. However, the unpredictable nature of SSLRs seems to contribute to caregiver reservations about pursuing testing for their child. To mitigate this, targeted education from health-care professionals, such as physicians, advanced practice providers, and nurses, may reduce caregiver hesitancy and facilitate BLA delabeling for patients with SSLRs.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41150029", "text": "Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease (PF-ILD) is a severe phenotype of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) with a poor prognosis, typically requiring prolonged clinical observation and multiple CT examinations for diagnosis. Such requirements delay early detection and treatment initiation. To enable earlier identification of PF-ILD, we propose ILD-Slider, a parameter-efficient and lightweight deep learning framework that enables accurate PF-ILD identification from a limited number of CT slices. ILD-Slider introduces anatomy-based position markers (PMs) to guide the selection of representative slices (RSs). A PM extractor, trained via a multi-class classification model, achieves high PM detection accuracy despite severe class imbalance by leveraging a peak slice mining (PSM)-based strategy. Using the PM extractor, we automatically select three, five, or nine RSs per case, substantially reducing computational cost while maintaining diagnostic accuracy. The selected RSs are then processed by a slice-level 3D Adapter (Slider) for PF-ILD identification. Experiments on 613 cases from The University of Osaka Hospital (UOH) and the National Hospital Organization Osaka Toneyama Medical Center (OTMC) demonstrate the effectiveness of ILD-Slider, achieving an AUPRC of 0.790 (AUROC 0.847) using only five automatically extracted RSs. ILD-Slider further validates the feasibility of diagnosing PF-ILD from non-contiguous slices, which is particularly valuable for real-world and public datasets where contiguous volumes are often unavailable. These results highlight ILD-Slider as a practical and efficient solution for early PF-ILD identification.", "source": "PubMed"}

We now recognize the heterogeneity of this condition, which is comprised of a number of endotypes and phenotypes. Laboratory testing to identify a cause for chronic urticaria has been discouraged, as this does not lead to improved outcomes and is not cost-effective; however, evidence has shown selected laboratory tests are important for their prognostic value. Therapeutic options for chronic urticaria, particularly for patients who are antihistamine-resistant, have also improved. Despite this, chronic urticaria has continued to be a vexatious condition for both patients and health care providers, and many patients continue to experience unmet needs. Guidelines recommend a step-care approach for management of chronic urticaria that can encourage substantial improvement in clinical course and quality of life. Use of anti-IgE therapy for more than the past decade has enabled many patients with antihistamine-resistant chronic urticaria to achieve improved outcomes; however, a substantial proportion continue to experience ongoing symptoms and impaired quality of life.

Patients were included if they received imipenem-relebactam for >48 h within 7 days of index P. aeruginosa culture. The primary outcome was clinical success at day 30, defined as survival, resolution of signs and symptoms of infection, completion of intended treatment course, and absence of recurrent infection. Secondary outcomes included 30- and 90-day mortality, infection recurrence, and development of non-susceptibility. Sixty-three patients were included. Median (IQR) age was 61 (51-70) years, and the median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 5 (3-6). Forty-six percent of patients had an immunocompromising condition, 79% were in the intensive care unit, 76% were receiving mechanical ventilation, and 48% required vasopressors.

This report summarizes the results of the Swiss national program for surveillance of influenza viruses in pigs by presenting data on their genetic diversity and on transmissions to humans between 2010 and 2022. Challenges and optimization options in the program are discussed. Nasal swabs or lung tissue samples from pigs with influenza-like signs were screened by real-time RT-PCR for swine influenza virus (SIV) genomes and the human seasonal strain A(H1N1)pdm09; positive samples were subtyped for H1, N1, H3 and N2. In parallel, humans with influenza-like symptoms and recent contact with diseased pigs were asked to sample themselves with a nasal swab. Human swabs were tested for IAV, and positive swabs further subtyped to identify potential cross-species transmission between swine and humans. In the pigs, SIV was detected in 375 of 674 farm visits. H1N1 was the only subtype detected in Swiss pigs so far. The human seasonal strain A(H1N1)pdm09 (Hemagglutinin (HA) clade 1A) was detected in seven out of 375 SIV positive farm visits. Phylogenetic analyses from partial HA and neuraminidase (NA) gene sequences indicate that the remaining pigs were infected with the Eurasian avian lineage (HA clade 1C), which is predominant in swine in Europe. The Swiss H1N1 strains form distinct phylogenetic clusters within HA clades 1C.2.1 and 1C.2.2 and seem to evolve comparably slowly. Infection of humans with SIV was identified in five cases. Sequence similarity analysis assigned the five viruses to the Eurasian avian lineage (C), clades 1C.2.1 and 1C.2.2. There was no evidence for sustained human-to-human transmission. Continued surveillance of influenza viruses at the swine-human interface is of major importance to enable early detection of new IAV subtypes and changes in the epidemiological situation.

Serum concentrations of MMP-1 and MMP-7 were quantified using chemiluminescence immunoassay. Positivity rates were compared across groups, and Spearman's correlation was used to examine the association between age and MMP expression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine optimal cut-off values and assess diagnostic performance. Median serum MMP-1 levels were higher in the LC group (22.9 ng/mL; IQR: 11.65-30.0) and PF group (26.5 ng/mL; IQR: 14.4-30.0) compared with the pneumonia group (15.4 ng/mL; IQR: 9.34-28.75) (p < 0.05). Similarly, MMP-7 levels were elevated in the LC (4.52 ng/mL; IQR: 3.55-6.20) and PF (5.05 ng/mL; IQR: 4.00-7.44) groups compared with the pneumonia (2.35 ng/mL; IQR: 1.87-3.36) and healthy control (2.27 ng/mL; IQR: 1.88-2.81) groups (p < 0.05). Significant intergroup differences in positivity rates were observed (p < 0.05). Age was positively correlated with both MMP-1 (rs = 0.215, p < 0.001) and MMP-7 (rs = 0.531, p < 0.001), with the correlation stronger for MMP-7. No statistically significant differences were found between sexes for MMP-1 (z = -1.033, p = 0.301) or MMP-7 (z = -1.326, p = 0.185).

Here, we report a very rare presentation of inflammatory bowel disease with pneumomediastinum, which is important for healthcare workers to be aware of because pneumomediastinum can present with rapid symptoms onset. Previous reported cases were mainly noted after long-term steroids use or scope-induced perforation. CASE REPORT We present a case a 23-year-old woman with a 14-day history of constipation followed by diarrhea (sometimes bloody), with vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever. She was initially managed as having acute gastroenteritis, but due to persist unexplained tachycardia, a chest CT was done, which incidentally showed a pneumomediastinum along with pulmonary embolism. The patient deteriorated significantly on the same day of chest imaging and developed severe lactic acidosis with hypoglycemia and severe hepatic injury. After extensive assessment by imaging and scopes for biopsy, she was diagnosed with fulminant Crohn's disease, causing severe liver injury, colitis, and pneumomediastinum. She improved significantly with steroids and was discharged home. On follow-up, immunosuppressive agents were initiated. CONCLUSIONS Pneumomediastinum is a rare manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease, which could be reflective of severe colitis and should be considered in patients presenting with chest symptoms regardless of procedure, scope exposure, or long-term steroids use.

{"id": "41202071", "text": "Could the microdroplets formed by viscoelastic fragmentation of mucosal liquids within the upper respiratory tract (URT) explain the brisk onset of deep lung infection following initial URT infections? Generally, particulates, inhaled through the nostrils and therefore navigating the intricate topography of the anterior nasal cavity, can efficiently reach the lower airway only if they are small enough, typically [Formula: see text]. However, the fate of larger particulates, many exceeding 5-[Formula: see text] in diameter, that are sheared from the initial infection sites along the intra-URT mucosa during inhalation remains unresolved. These particulates originate primarily from the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and the laryngeal chamber containing the vocal folds. To investigate, this study employs a computed tomography-based three-dimensional anatomical airway reconstruction, isolating the tract from the larynx and mapping the tracheal cavity through to the third generation of the tracheobronchial tree; constituent transport across the distal bronchial outlets is also recorded to assess deep lung penetration. Within the defined geometry, airflow simulations are conducted with the Large Eddy Simulation scheme to replicate relaxed inhalation at 15 L/min flow rate. Against the ambient air flux, numerical experiments are performed to monitor the downwind transport of particulates (aerosols/droplets) with diameters [Formula: see text], bearing physical properties akin to aerosolized mucus with embedded virions. The full-scale numerical transmission trends, representatively validated against a small set of published experimental data, are consistent with findings from our reduced-order mathematical model that conceptualizes the influence of intra-airway vortex instabilities on local particle transport through point vortex idealization in an anatomy-guided two-dimensional potential flow domain. The results collectively demonstrate a markedly elevated lower airway penetration by URT-derived particulates, even by those as large as 10 and 15 [Formula: see text]. The high viral load, often exceeding the pathogen-specific infectious dose, carried by such droplets into the bronchial spaces of the sample airway, provides a plausible mechanistic explanation for the accelerated seeding of secondary lung infection.", "source": "PubMed"}

{"id": "40779565", "text": "Lung diseases (LGDs) are related to an extensive range of lung disorders, including pneumonia (PNEUM), lung cancer (LC), tuberculosis (TB), and COVID-19 etc. The diagnosis of LGDs is performed by using different medical imaging such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI. However, LGDs contain similar symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat, making it challenging for radiologists to classify these LGDs. If LGDs are not diagnosed at their initial phase, they may produce severe complications or even death. An automated classifier is required for the classification of LGDs. Thus, this study aims to propose a novel model named lung diseases classification network (LGD_Net) based on the combination of a capsule network (CapsNet) with the extreme learning machine (ELM) for the classification of five different LGDs such as PNEUM, LC, TB, COVID-19 omicron (COO), and normal (NOR) using CT scans. The LGD_Net model is trained and tested on the five publicly available benchmark datasets. The datasets contain an imbalanced distribution of images; therefore, a borderline SMOTE (BL_SMT) approach is applied to handle this problem. Additionally, the affine transformation methods are used to enhance LGD datasets. The performance of the LGD_Net is compared with four CNN-based baseline models such as Vgg-19 (D1), ResNet-101 (D2), Inception-v3 (D3), and DenseNet-169 (D4). The LGD_Net model achieves an accuracy of 99.71% in classifying LGDs using CT scans. While the other models such as D1, D2, D3, and D4 attains an accuracy of 91.21%, 94.39%, 93.96%, and 93.82%, respectively. The findings demonstrate that the LGD_Net model works significantly as compared to D1, D2, D3, and D4 as well as state-of-the-art (SOTA). Thus, this study concludes that the LGD_Net model provides significant assistance to radiologists in classifying several LGDs.", "source": "PubMed"}

{"id": "41152683", "text": "Background: Allergen immunotherapy (IT) in Europe is generally administered as monoallergen IT. However, in some patients and in other parts of the world, multiallergen IT is common practice. A key question is whether allergens in a mixture retain their allergenicity over time. Objective: To demonstrate if allergenicity, as measured by skin-prick testing (SPT), is maintained after 6 months in a sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) maintenance vial with three allergen extracts in a single individual vaccine, including two pollens and Dermatophagoides. Methods: We prepared two maintenance SLIT vials that contained mixed Dermatophagoides species (2000 AU/mL), ash tree and Bermuda grass pollens (1:50 w/v), one 6 months before SPT and the second 0-2 weeks before SPT, and three fresh vials (0-2 weeks before SPT) for each individual allergen. Duplicate SPTs were conducted with all five vials, diluent and positive (histamine 1 mg/mL) controls. Wheals were measured at 10 minutes (controls) and 20 minutes (allergen vaccines). The mean wheal diameter was calculated as the average of the longest and orthogonal diameters, i.e., (D1 + D\u2082)/2. For each allergen extract, two replicate wheals were obtained per participant; their mean diameters were averaged to yield a patient-level mean wheal diameter. These patient-level means were then averaged across all the participants. The paired t-test was used to calculate statistically significant differences between the mean wheal diameters of the extracts, with significance at p < 0.05. Results: The mean \u00b1 standard deviation wheal diameter produced by the 6-month-old and the fresh extracts were 8.7 \u00b1 3.3 mm and 8.4 \u00b1 2.87 mm, respectively. This difference was not significant. Moreover, the potency of both pollen extracts was conserved when mixed with house-dust mite extracts.

{"id": "41170023", "text": "Respiratory allergies are a major global health issue due to their high prevalence and burden on patients, societies, and the health care system. In addition to symptom-relieving pharmacotherapy, allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only disease-modifying treatment option currently available that has the potential to prevent disease progression and the onset of asthma. The importance of AIT varies greatly from country to country. To discuss the different aspects of AIT, 20 experts from 12 European countries met for the First European Think Tank on Allergen Immunotherapy. The aim of the meeting was to formulate an expert position for improving the clinical care of patients with respiratory allergies in Europe, particularly concerning the use of AIT. The lacking class effect requires a product-specific assessment of AIT products for the most common allergens available in different European countries. Adherence, appropriate prescription, and early initiation - potentially to prevent disease progression - were identified as most important challenges for practical use of AIT. The shared decision-making on either sublingual or subcutaneous AIT may be based on safety and efficacy profiles, patient preferences, and clinical setting. Future challenges with regard to the application of AIT are as follows: to increase awareness for AIT among payers, health care providers, pharmacists, and patients; to better define patients who benefit the most of AIT; to improve the training of general practitioners on AIT as the first point of contact for allergy patients regarding allergy diagnosis and treatment, including AIT; to increase the awareness of AIT as a causal treatment option; to improve the training of primary care pediatricians with regard to AIT to ensure early initiation of AIT in cooperation with allergy specialists; to enhance the guidance of physicians through relevant AIT guidelines; and to provide them with more detailed scientific guidance for selecting the adequate products to achieve optimal benefits for their patients.", "source": "PubMed"}

This emphasizes the need for reliable, radiation-free imaging and automated analysis of lung disease activity. We present a deep learning-based approach for classifying two key pathologies, bronchiectasis/wall thickening and mucus plugging, on T2-weighted chest MRI. Retrospectively, 627 MRI scans from 164 patients (mean age 7.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.2 years; range 0.1-53.0 years) were collected. Chest MRI were preprocessed with an nnU-Net to segment lung halves, followed by an atlas-based lung lobe approximation. Leveraging a dual-view architecture processing coronal and axial slices, our approach addresses limitations inherent in manual scoring, such as reader variability and substantial labor requirements. We evaluated a single model trained on all lobes and models specialized for each lobe. Cross-validation revealed substantial agreement for mucus plugging (\u03ba = 0.68) with strong discrimination (macro AUROC = 0.90) and excellent reliability (Pearson's r\u202f=\u202f0.84). For bronchiectasis/wall thickening, agreement was moderate (\u03ba = 0.53) but discrimination remained strong (macro AUROC = 0.87), with Pearson's r\u202f=\u202f0.74. The mean differences and 95\u202f% limits of agreement for both pathologies aligned closely with the reader variability previously reported. Grad-CAM analyses demonstrated spatial alignment of model attention with relevant pathologies, and external testing on ten patients from an independent centre confirmed promising generalization.

Physical examination was unremarkable except for mild lower abdominal tenderness. Laboratory studies, chest radiography, and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Colonoscopy revealed multiple areas of cobblestoning in the terminal ileum. Histopathology demonstrated mucosal and submucosal lymphocytic infiltrates with prominent lymphoid follicles and no granulomas.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of Crohn's disease was established, and the patient was started on azathioprine, prednisolone, and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, with subsequent marked clinical improvement. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of differentiating pediatric Crohn's disease from intestinal tuberculosis in endemic regions and underscores the importance of maintaining a broad differential diagnosis.

The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains makes these infections life-threatening. To overcome this challenge, lysocins can be employed as novel antipseudomonals. Lysocins use components of the pyocin antimicrobial system to deliver bacteriophage lysins to their peptidoglycan substrate in Pseudomonas. Peptidoglycan cleavage causes membrane destabilization, cytoplasmic leakage, and disruption of the proton motive force, thereby killing the cell. In our previous proof-of-concept study, the PyS2-GN4 lysocin killed only one-third of P. aeruginosa strains due to the targeted receptor. This limitation can now be circumvented by engineering second-generation lysocins that bind and translocate through highly conserved Pseudomonas-specific receptors. One lysocin, PyS5-I-GN4, uses a single domain from pyocin S5 to deliver the GN4 lysin through the conserved ferric pyochelin transporter, consequently killing 95% of multidrug-resistant clinical isolates tested. Importantly, PyS5-I-GN4 displayed antibiofilm properties and was bactericidal in serum and lung surfactant. Serum inactivation observed for lysins is not seen for lysocins, making this approach more effective for treating systemic Gram-negative bacterial infections. Despite its broadened pseudomonal strain coverage, PyS5-I-GN4 demonstrated narrow-spectrum antibacterial activity toward P. aeruginosa only and lacked cytotoxicity toward human cells. A single dose of lysocin was protective and reduced bacteria multiple log10-fold in the lungs and secondary organs in a neutropenic murine lung infection model.

Clinical tools such as the Bronchiectasis Aetiology Comorbidity Index (BACI) can assist clinicians in assessing the burden and prognostic impact of comorbidities. This review advocates for a paradigm shift: moving beyond a lung-centric model toward a holistic approach that recognizes bronchiectasis as a multisystem condition. This perspective emphasizes the early identification of comorbidities, implementation of practical screening strategies, and collaboration with specialists such as dieticians, psychologists, and immunologists. Addressing comorbid conditions alongside the management of bronchiectasis may alleviate symptoms, reduce infection rates, and improve overall well-being. We propose that this integrated, patient-centered approach will lead to more effective and individualized care for individuals living with bronchiectasis.", "source": "PubMed"}

For this, a thorough search of relevant information presented for 2018-2023 in the Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted. The study found that one third of the world's population suffers from allergies, and 20% of them are diagnosed with metal allergies. To date, 45 metals have been identified as causing allergic reactions. The main routes of exposure to metals are inhalation, contact, oral, and parenteral. The following diseases develop as a result of metal exposure: various types of contact dermatitis, urticaria, anaphylactic reactions, conjunctivitis, rhinitis, ulcerative colitis, arthralgia, stomatitis, gingivitis, and bronchial asthma. The main diagnostic method is the patch test. Allergy treatment depends on the type of allergic reaction. In case of immediate allergic reactions, emergency treatment with epinephrine is required. For diseases that develop as delayed allergic reactions, the use of corticosteroids and antihistamines is effective. Allergenic metals should be avoided to prevent the onset and development of allergies. For this, it is advisable to use gloves, protective creams, and masks. It is essential to carefully read the composition of the products used and individually select alternative non-allergenic materials. The prescription of a diet aimed at correcting the content of metals in the body improves the general condition of patients and reduces the severity of symptoms. Thus, metal allergy is a common pathology that causes the development of a wide range of diseases of varying severity.", "source": "PubMed"}

{"id": "41224266", "text": "Objectives To investigate the association between malnutrition status on admission and short-term swallowing recovery in acute ischemic stroke. Methods We retrospectively analyzed patients with acute ischemic stroke and dysphagia who were admitted to our institute between January 2018 and December 2020. The swallowing function was assessed using the Food Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), and patients with initial FOIS levels of 1-3, which represent tube-dependent nutrition, were enrolled. Poor swallowing recovery was defined as a FOIS score of 1-3 on day 14. The nutritional status at admission was assessed using the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) and categorized as follows: >98, no nutritional risk; 92-98, mild nutritional risk; 82-92, moderate nutritional risk; and <82, severe nutritional risk. Results Among 189 patients (median age, 85 years; male, 39%), 123 (65%) had poor swallowing recovery. This group had a higher NIHSS score, a lower rate of improvement with reperfusion therapy, a higher rate of aspiration pneumonia, and a lower GNRI. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, a lower GNRI was independently associated with poor swallowing recovery [per-point decrease; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.07]. Furthermore, when \"severe\" and \"moderate\" nutritional risk were analyzed as a single class, moderate or severe nutritional risk (GNRI <92) was independently associated with poor swallowing recovery (adjusted OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.14-6.67), relative to no nutritional risk (GNRI >98).

This study examined the association between the timing of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir initiation and post-acute outcomes more precisely using territory-wide data in Hong Kong. We included patients aged \u226518 years who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March 16, 2022, and November 9, 2023, and were hospitalized with COVID-19. Treatment groups were formed based on the time from the positive RT-PCR date to nirmatrelvir-ritonavir initiation. Among 15,978 patients who received nirmatrelvir-ritonavir, 10,028 (62.8%) patients were included in Day 0 group, 4973 (31.1%) in Day 1 group, and 977 (6.1%) in Day 2 or later group. The control group comprised 22,312 patients who did not receive nirmatrelvir-ritonavir. Compared with the control group, the risks of post-acute mortality were significantly lower in Day 0 group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.51, 95% CI 0.46-0.56; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and Day 1 group (HR 0.66, CI 0.59-0.74; p\u2009<\u20090.0001), but not in Day 2 or later group. Meta-regression results showed that more immediate initiation was associated with lower risks of death and all-cause hospitalization. Our findings suggested that the antiviral should be prescribed immediately after COVID-19 diagnosis for achieving its greatest benefit on improving post-COVID outcomes.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41156576", "text": "Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains a global health problem. One of the characteristic features of mycobacteria is their exceptional resistance to environmental factors and their slow growth rate, both of which significantly prolong microbiological diagnostics. Due to the mortality rate and the rising prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), early detection and prompt initiation of treatment are extremely important. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic examination and culture on solid and liquid media, are still important, but are time-consuming and resource-intensive. However, the dynamic development of nucleic acid amplification techniques (NAATs), genotyping assays, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has accelerated the identification of mycobacteria and the detection of drug resistance. Early and precise diagnosis is essential for effective disease control and improved treatment outcomes. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge on tuberculosis; including biological and structural characteristics of mycobacteria; the epidemiology of the disease; and the role of the main diagnostic methods; with a particular focus on molecular methods and MALDI-TOF MS. This paper highlights their advantages and limitations and discusses their implications for the future of TB diagnosis and control.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41208110", "text": "The generation and function of effector and memory CD8+ T cells are crucial for effective immune responses and long-term immunity. Using gene expression analysis, we found that doublesex- and mab-3-related transcription factor like family A1 (Dmrta1), a member of the DMRT family of transcription factors, is highly expressed in activated and memory CD8+ T cells. In this study, we investigated the role of Dmrta1 in the activation and differentiation of CD8+ T cells. The Dmrta1-deficient (Dmrta1-KO) mice showed an equivalent number of thymic and splenic T cells compared with wild-type mice. Dmrta1 deficiency in T cells resulted in impaired early activation of CD8+ but not CD4+ T cells and reduced expression of granzyme B in CD8+ T cells following influenza virus infection. Although virus-specific CD8+ T cell numbers and cytotoxicity in the lung were comparable between wild-type and Dmrta1-deficient mice during primary infection, Dmrta1-KO mice exhibited a transient accumulation of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleen with reduced cytotoxic activity. Upon secondary challenge, memory CD8+ T cells from Dmrta1-KO mice showed persistent defects in granzyme B expression and cytotoxic function. These findings demonstrate that Dmrta1 modulates the early activation of na\u00efve CD8+ T cells and supports the cytotoxic functionality of both effector and memory CD8+ T cells, particularly in secondary lymphoid organs, with significant implications for antiviral immunity.", "source": "PubMed"}

The increase in international travel has resulted in cases of leishmaniasis emerging in nonendemic regions, often creating challenges in diagnosis. We report a case of presumptive MCL and VL in a 20-year-old female who complained of multiple skin rashes on the face and body, accompanied by erosions on the lips and eyes. A physical examination showed erosions on the eyes, lips, vulva, and \"volcanic\" noduloulcerative skin lesions covered with adherent crusts on the face, neck, upper and lower extremities. A biopsy of the skin lesion revealed structures resembling Leishman-Donovan bodies, then the diagnosis of MCL was established. The patient was given 200 mg/day of itraconazole. On the 12th day of itraconazole treatment, the patient experienced shortness of breath and was hospitalized in the Internal Medicine Department. The laboratory examination showed anemia, thrombocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels. Computed tomography of the thorax revealed ground-glass opacity, suggestive of lung inflammation. Bone marrow aspiration showed features of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and abdominal ultrasound revealed hepatomegaly. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with VL and was treated with amphotericin B. Unfortunately, the patient died due to respiratory failure. Diagnosing leishmaniasis in nonendemic countries is challenging due to the lack of diagnostic tools to identify the protozoa.

The patients were divided into observation (28 patients) and control (15 patients) groups based on whether they had a coinfection with gram-negative bacteria. The clinical data of the two groups were compared, and multivariate regression analysis was performed.ResultsThe mean age in the observation group was 2.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.53 years; 26 (92.86%) patients were aged \u22645 years, and 11 (39.3%) had underlying diseases. The mean age in the control group was 4.07\u2009\u00b1\u20092.11 years; 10 (66.67%) patients were aged \u22645 years, and 2 (13.33%) had underlying diseases. The differences in age and the proportion of children with underlying diseases were statistically significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The observation group had a longer duration of fever, higher number of patients with fever lasting \u22657 days and higher incidence of gasping, with statistically significant differences (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The C-reactive protein level, procalcitonin level, platelet count and monocyte count in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Among the gram-negative bacterial coinfections in the observation group, coinfections with Haemophilus influenzae (21 cases, 75%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (7 cases, 25%) were predominant. The observation group had a higher proportion of paediatric intensive care unit admissions and longer hospital stays than the control group. Additionally, significantly fewer patients in the observation group received neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral therapy within 48\u2009h (P\u2009<\u20090.05). In the observation group, all H. influenzae isolates were sensitive to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and meropenem, while resistance rates to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, cefuroxime and ampicillin/sulbactam were 60.4%, 75%, 27.8% and 6.2%, respectively. All M. catarrhalis isolates were sensitive to ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/sulbactam and ciprofloxacin, whereas resistance rates to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were 67.9% and 10.7%, respectively.ConclusionSevere influenza A virus pneumonia complicated by gram-negative bacterial infection is more common in children aged <5 years. Younger age and the presence of underlying diseases increase the likelihood of gram-negative bacterial coinfection. Persistent fever, wheezing and significant elevations in C-reactive protein level, procalcitonin level, platelet count and monocyte count are important early warning signs for the clinical identification of gram-negative bacterial infection.", "source": "PubMed"}

Materials and Methods In this retrospective multicenter study (January 2011-December 2022), an automated machine learning algorithm measured periaortic FAI of the descending thoracic aorta at noncontrast CT. Patients who underwent CT for chest or back pain were included to compare FAI between those with acute aortic dissection, including both type A and B, and those without. Further, prognostic evaluation of patients with uncomplicated TBAD was conducted using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Results A total of 688 patients (median age, 69 years [IQR, 56-79]; 400 male patients), including 380 with acute aortic dissection and 308 without, were analyzed for the diagnostic characteristics of FAI, and 135 patients with uncomplicated TBAD (median age, 70 years [IQR, 59-79]; 90 male patients) were followed up for prognosis. FAI values at initial presentation were higher in patients with acute aortic dissection than in those without (median, -74.5 vs -78.7 HU; P < .001). In patients with uncomplicated TBAD, FAI values peaked on the 6th day after onset. These patients were divided into two groups according to the median peak FAI value of -64 HU. During a median follow up of 529 days, those with higher peak FAI values (\u2265-64 HU) had higher rates of all-cause death and aortic events (log-rank P < .001). High peak FAI independently predicted these events (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.54 [95% CI: 1.69, 12.21]; P = .003). Conclusion A higher peak FAI value was an independent risk factor for adverse events in patients with uncomplicated TBAD.

{"id": "41129477", "text": "BACKGROUND Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterized by remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a coagulation disorder primarily characterized by an antiphospholipid antibody-mediated prothrombotic state. Both SLE and APS can be associated with Libman-Sacks endocarditis (LSE), which may induce subendocardial inflammation followed by thrombosis and fibrosis. We report a rare case of non-valvular left-ventricular LSE in a patient with SLE/APS. These findings underscore the protean cardiac manifestations of SLE/APS-associated disease. CASE REPORT A 19-year-old woman with a 2-year history of SLE and APS presented with intermittent chest discomfort and dizziness for 4 months. Laboratory investigations revealed positive autoantibodies (antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, anticardiolipin IgG, anti-\u00df2GPI); reduced complement (C3: 42.1 mg/dL, C4: 3 mg/dL); elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 96 mm/h), and mild cardiac enzyme abnormalities. Multimodal imaging demonstrated a 27\u00d720 mm hypoechoic, non-perfused mass in the left-ventricular inferior wall on transthoracic and myocardial contrast echocardiography. Adjacent myocardium showed regional hypokinesis and wall thinning. Cardiac magnetic resonance further revealed transmural late gadolinium enhancement, confirming non-valvular LSE. Treatment included methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide, belimumab, hydroxychloroquine, and warfarin. Six months later, the patient was clinically stable, and repeat imaging showed fibrotic transformation of the thrombus and partial recovery of regional wall motion. CONCLUSIONS This rare case of non-valvular Libman-Sacks endocarditis highlights the intricate interplay between SLE/APS and LSE. Multimodal imaging coupled with serologic testing is essential for accurate diagnosis. Long-term combined immunosuppressive and anticoagulant therapy proved effective, but further longitudinal and mechanistic studies are needed to optimize management of such rare complications.", "source": "PubMed"}

The aim of this study was to establish a nomogram for predicting respiratory failure development in SFTS patients with pneumonia. Data of demographics, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, laboratory parameters, complications, and outcomes of SFTS patients with pneumonia were collected. Independent predictors of respiratory failure development on multivariate logistic regression were used to construct the predictive model. Of the 167 SFTS patients with pneumonia we studied, 45 (26.9%) patients developed respiratory failure. Patients who developed respiratory failure had a higher incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, nosocomial infections, myocarditis, acute kidney injury (AKI) stage 2 or 3, rhabdomyolysis, shock, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Among them, 35 patients died and all patients without respiratory failure survived. On multivariate regression analysis, neurological manifestations, nosocomial infections, AKI stage 2 or 3, SIRS, serum levels of albumin, and CKMB were proven to be independent predictors for respiratory failure development, which were adopted as parameters of the nomogram. The nomogram showed good calibration and discrimination, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.932 (95% CI 0.888-0.975). Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of the predictive model. Respiratory failure is associated with adverse outcomes including severe complications and death in SFTS patients with pneumonia.

Interleukin-5 (IL-5) inhibition may disrupt this pathogenic cascade. We reviewed contemporary evidence on IL-5 blockade in EM and contextualized it with an illustrative case. Methods: We searched PubMed through May 2025 for reports of EM treated with mepolizumab or benralizumab. Inclusion criteria were consistent with prior cohorts: acute cardiac symptoms with biomarker elevation plus abnormalities on transthoracic echocardiography and/or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), along with documented IL-5-targeted therapy. We extracted clinical, imaging, biopsy, treatment-timing, and outcome data and included one institutional case. Results: Twenty-one episodes were analyzed (median age, 45 years; 10 men). Underlying conditions included eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (10 cases; 48%), hypereosinophilic syndrome (5 cases; 24%), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS, 3 cases; 14%), and eosinophilic asthma (3 cases; 14%). Treatments involved mepolizumab in 17 cases (81%) and benralizumab in 4 (19%); 4 patients received \"early-start\" therapy within 14 days of EM diagnosis. Among the 11 episodes with reported left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline and follow-up, the median baseline LVEF was 40% (range, 30-62), with 10 of 11 (91%) <50%. On follow-up, all 11 patients improved: 4 normalized (\u226550%) and 7 improved to 40-49%. CMR (n = 18) demonstrated late gadolinium enhancement in 14 cases (78%), edema in 9 (50%), and intracardiac thrombus in 4 (22%). Endomyocardial biopsy confirmed eosinophilic infiltration in 13 of 15 cases (87%). Outcomes included one death (fulminant DRESS), one recovery following veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and one successful heart transplantation. Illustrative case: A 24-year-old man on a steroid taper received mepolizumab 300 mg on Day 4. His LVEF improved from 47% to 59% by Day 15, accompanied by biomarker decline and successful steroid tapering. Conclusions: Across published cases and our institutional experience, IL-5-targeted therapy appears safe, steroid-sparing, and associated with rapid ventricular recovery, particularly when initiated early.

{"id": "41197192", "text": "Class-incremental learning helps models adapt to new classes without past data. This supports long-term learning. In medical imaging, it integrates new diseases or imaging methods over time. CIL models for natural images struggle in chest x-rays diagnosis. Conversely, deep learning models that excel in chest x-ray diagnosis tend to suffer from catastrophic forgetting in a class-incremental setting. To address this, we propose a novel class-incremental learning framework specifically designed for chest x-ray analysis. Our approach utilizes both abnormality-specific and abnormality-agnostic information from the input data. We designed a model, the Push-Pull Autoencoder (PPAE), that uses a dual latent space representation to refine feature representations by disentangling abnormality-specific from abnormality-agnostic information. This enhances the model's understanding of disease features. PPAE is trained in such a way that it brings the training samples closer together based on shared, abnormality-agnostic features, while simultaneously distinguishing them using abnormality-specific features. To retain critical knowledge without exhaustive retraining, we employ a coreset generation algorithm that selects representative exemplars from previous classes. This approach maintains diagnostic accuracy on previously learned diseases while adapting seamlessly to new classes. PPAE addresses the problem of catastrophic forgetting prominent in class-incremental learning. Experimental results show up to 3% improvement in terms of F1 score and up to 4% improvement in terms of AUROC across various chest x-ray datasets. It validates the robustness of our framework in incremental learning tasks, highlighting its potential to advance continuous chest x-ray diagnosis.", "source": "PubMed"}

Using LC-MS analysis, we identified caffeic acid and m-geranyl-p-dihydroxybenzoic acid as two main phenols and methylated derivatives of kaempferol and luteolin as the main flavonoids presented in AEIB. The impact of AEIB on the amyloid fibrillation and cytotoxicity of human insulin was examined using ThT fluorescence assay, circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, MTT-based cell viability assay, intracellular ROS content and mitochondrial membrane potential measurements, and hemolysis assay. The obtained results indicate that AEIB can significantly inhibit the amyloid assembly and cytotoxicity of human insulin. Based on the seeding experiments, we propose that binding to and stabilizing monomeric/partially unfolded species may be the main mechanism by which AEIB modulates fibrillogenesis of human insulin. Moreover, we found that green synthesis of metal-based nanoparticles is an effective strategy to improve the anti-amyloidogenic effects of AEIB. Molecular docking studies indicate the binding of two main constituents of AEIB to monomeric form of human insulin.

{"id": "41130281", "text": "Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome characterized by bleeding from the pulmonary microcirculation into alveolar spaces. It typically presents with acute respiratory failure, anemia, and diffuse radiological infiltrates. Importantly hemoptysis may be absent in up to half of cases. Etiologies are diverse, encompassing systemic vasculitides, connective tissue diseases, coagulopathies, drugs, infections, hemodynamic disturbances, and idiopathic processes. Histopathologically, DAH manifests as one of three overlapping patterns: pulmonary capillaritis, bland alveolar hemorrhage, or diffuse alveolar damage, which help guide diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Capillaritis, commonly associated with immune-mediated vasculitis such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, typically necessitating prompt and aggressive immunosuppression. In contrast, bland hemorrhage often reflects coagulopathy or hemodynamic factors, whereas diffuse alveolar damage is linked to toxins, infections, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Prompt recognition and systematic evaluation are critical to optimizing outcomes, given DAH's high in-hospital mortality exceeding 20%. Diagnosis relies on a combination of imaging, bronchoalveolar lavage (demonstrating progressively bloodier returns and hemosiderin-laden macrophages), and targeted laboratory evaluation for vasculitis, infection, and coagulopathy. Management includes patient stabilization with supplementary oxygen or indeed ventilatory support, careful avoidance of ventilator-induced lung injury, and etiology-directed therapy. High-dose corticosteroids, cytotoxic agents, and rituximab remain central in immune-mediated cases, whereas plasma exchange is indicated in anti-glomerular basement membrane disease and severe refractory hemoptysis. Antimicrobial therapy, drug withdrawal, hemostatic interventions, and, in select cases, extracorporeal support may also be required. This review outlines the histopathological spectrum, etiologic categories, diagnostic algorithms, and evidence-based therapeutic approaches to DAH, emphasizing the importance of early multidisciplinary management to improve survival and functional recovery.", "source": "PubMed"}

Clinical expertise served as the reference method. We propose assessing the inter-rater agreement in interpreting TAB and ultrasound images collected in this study. From 2016 to 2020, 165 patients with high suspicion of GCA were enrolled in the ECHORTON study at four general hospitals and two university hospitals. Pathologists and vascular medicine experts independently reviewed TAB and ultrasounds, respectively. The TAB samples were stained with eosin and silver and classified as positive, negative, or equivocal for GCA. Ultrasound results were considered positive when halos were detected around the lumen of both temporal arteries using 9-4 to 18-6 MHz linear probes. This study involved double-blind analysis of 4384 sections from 77 TAB, and 5781 images from 132 ultrasound scans.

It draws together the influence of knowledge of vaccine actions on threat and coping and how these factors drive intentions to act and to be vaccinated. The data were obtained from 315 Indian university students using a cross-sectional design and analyzed using PLS-SEM. The core constructs were perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, self-efficacy, response efficacy, response cost, behavioral intention, and vaccine acceptance. The findings indicate that vaccine-related knowledge significantly enhances perceived severity and response efficacy, which positively influences behavioral intention and acceptance. Mediation analysis confirmed the indirect effect of coping appraisals, whereas moderation analysis revealed that Vaccine Attitude Hesitancy (VAH) moderated the relationship between knowledge, intention, and acceptance. A simple slope analysis further validates these effects. This study contributes to the understanding of vaccine hesitancy by integrating the PMT and TPB, offering valuable implications for public health communication strategies.

{"id": "41151487", "text": "The influenza virus, primarily causing respiratory issues, often triggers gastrointestinal symptoms, hinting at a complex lung-gut inflammatory crosstalk. Despite its clinical significance, the timing and mechanisms underlying this intersystem inflammation remain elusive. Leveraging a mouse model of influenza-induced pneumonitis and enteritis, we integrated time-course metabolomics with dynamic network biomarker (DNB) analysis to uncover pivotal transitions and potential molecular mechanisms. Two critical tipping points were identified at 1-2\u00a0days post-infection (dpi) and 6 dpi, after which the disease course markedly shifted. Metabolite clustering highlighted significant alterations in arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism at 1-2 dpi, implicating its likely involvement in modulating pulmonary and intestinal inflammation. By 6 dpi, prominent changes in both AA and bile acid (BA) metabolism were observed, suggesting the potential existence of an inflammatory feedback loop that may amplify systemic inflammation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that 16 AA and BA metabolites (AUC\u00a0>\u00a00.7) have diagnostic potential as biomarkers.

{"id": "41221053", "text": "Chronic multilobar segmental bronchial stenosis (CMBS) is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by stenosis across multiple lobar and segmental bronchi, primarily diagnosed via bronchoscopy. Epidemiologically, its prevalence exhibits significant regional variation, ranging from 0.1% to 22.5%, with higher rates observed in developing countries, rural populations, women, and individuals with a history of tuberculosis. Clinically, CMBS manifests as progressive dyspnea, chronic cough, recurrent pulmonary infections, and obstructive ventilatory dysfunction that is typically poorly responsive to bronchodilators. Radiologically, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) reveals characteristic bronchial wall thickening, luminal narrowing, and often associated mediastinal or peribronchial calcified lymph nodes. Long-term exposure to biomass fuel smoke (e.g., from wood or coal combustion), is established as a major etiological factor. Other significant risk factors include prior tuberculosis infection, and occupational exposures to inhalable irritants like silica dust in mining or textile workers. Despite its considerable global disease burden, the precise pathogenesis remains elusive. Research has identified transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) as a pivotal regulator of airway remodeling in various chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Notably, animal models of chronic biomass smoke exposure demonstrate a significant correlation between upregulated TGF-\u03b21 expression and a distinct airway remodeling phenotype, suggesting its potential involvement in the pathological progression of CMBS. Accumulating evidence indicates that TGF-\u03b21 mediates airway remodeling through multiple intricate mechanisms, including immune dysregulation, fibroblast activation and proliferation, aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and pathological vascular remodeling. In recent years, groundbreaking progress has been made in research on therapeutics targeting the TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathway, including monoclonal antibodies (e.g., Fresolimumab), small molecule kinase inhibitors (e.g., Galunisertib, TEW-7197), and novel targeted delivery systems. This review systematically summarizes the molecular mechanisms of TGF-\u03b21 in CMBS airway remodeling and the advances in the development of targeted drugs. Furthermore, it proposes future research directions focused on CMBS-specific applications, such as validating these therapeutics in preclinical CMBS models, developing inhaled formulations for localized delivery, establishing biomarker-driven patient stratification, and exploring combination therapies with anti-fibrotic agents. This aims to provide a comprehensive theoretical foundation for elucidating the disease's pathology and developing novel, precise diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CMBS.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "40805128", "text": "Background: Pseudoprogression is known to occur after immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy in brain metastasis and can complicate clinical decision-making. Still, its incidence, timing, and clinical presentation remain unclear. A retrospective cohort study in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer brain metastasis patients was conducted to address this. Materials and Methods: Brain metastasis patients showing progression on MRI according to response assessment in neuro-oncology brain metastases criteria after starting ICI therapy were included, irrespective of prior irradiation. Lesions were classified as tumour progression (TP) or pseudoprogression based on three-month radiological follow-up or histopathology. TP was assigned if progression was again shown at three months. Pseudoprogression was assigned if lesions showed stability, partial, or complete response at three months. 'Non-classified' lesions were those with new or changed treatment during follow-up. Results: A cohort of 98 patients with 233 lesions was included over a 13-year period; 170 lesions were considered non-classified, and 41 and 22 lesions were classified as TP and pseudoprogression respectively. This resulted in a lesion- and patient-specific incidence for pseudoprogression of 9.4% and 17.3% respectively. Due to the large number of lesions that could not be classified, as is the case in clinical practice, the reported incidence in this study is likely an underestimation and can be seen as a 'minimum' incidence rate. Ten pseudoprogression (45.5%) and 13 (31.7%) TP lesions were previously irradiated. Pseudoprogression occurred at a median of 2.7 months after starting ICI therapy. The only clinical feature distinguishing patients with TP from pseudoprogression was that TP patients were more likely to need dexamethasone for neurological symptoms. Conclusions: Pseudoprogression has a lesion-specific incidence rate of at least 9.4% and occurs at a median of 2.7 months after starting ICI therapy. Severe neurological symptoms requiring dexamethasone may be a clinical feature typical for TP.", "source": "PubMed"}

Thirteen of 14 puppies from 2 litters died, with 10 being submitted for necropsy. Three puppies from one litter struggled since birth to suckle and died. Five puppies from an additional litter died after presenting due to failure to thrive, depression, and lethargy. All puppies exhibited microscopic lesions consistent with septicemia represented by interstitial necrotizing pneumonia, random hepatocellular necrosis, or intravascular bacteria.

{"id": "41150167", "text": "Background/Objectives: Children with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) require repeated imaging, primarily standing spine radiography, while CT may be required for surgical planning, resulting in higher radiation exposure. Spectral shaping using a tin filter can reduce radiation dose in non-contrast chest CT. This study evaluated the efficacy of spectral shaping using a tin filter for reducing radiation dose in CT imaging in AIS and its impact on image quality. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 51 AIS patients who underwent spine CT between February 2017 and March 2022, and divided them into two groups: normal-dose CT (NDCT) and low-dose CT with spectral shaping with a tin filter (LDCT). Radiation doses and image quality were compared between the groups. Radiation dose was recorded as the volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) and the dose length product emitted from the device, and effective and equivalent doses obtained from simulations. Results: The use of spectral shaping with a tin filter resulted in a 75% reduction in radiation dose compared to conventional CT without any reduction in image quality. Conclusions: Spectral shaping CT with a tin filter can substantially reduce radiation dose while maintaining image quality. It may be considered a safer alternative to conventional CT when clinically indicated in AIS patients.", "source": "PubMed"}

We aimed to evaluate the association between CPD and clinical outcomes in hemodialysis patients, stratified by age. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Research Network. Adults aged 45-64 or \u226565 years initiating maintenance hemodialysis were included. CPD exposure was defined using ICD-10-CM codes documented within 6 months before or up to 5 years after hemodialysis initiation. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, pneumonia, fracture, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) over a 5-year follow-up period. Propensity score matching was conducted within each age group using a comprehensive model that included age, sex, race, comorbidities, medications, and laboratory values. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox models. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess robustness and effect modification. Results: CPD was significantly associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality in both younger (aHR = 1.313, 95% CI: 1.129-1.527; p<0.001) and older patients (aHR = 1.126, 95% CI: 1.048-1.209; p=0.001), with stronger associations in the younger group. Subgroup analysis showed elevated mortality risks in younger males, females, and non-diabetic individuals. Pneumonia risk was significantly increased across both age groups, with particularly high risks in younger females and older males. CPD was also associated with a higher risk of fracture, particularly among older adults (aHR = 1.673, 95% CI: 1.375-2.036; p<0.001), with consistent findings across subgroups. No significant associations were observed between CPD and MACE in either age stratum. Sensitivity analyses adjusting for comorbidities and inflammatory markers supported the primary findings. Conclusion: CPD is associated with increased risks of mortality, pneumonia, and fractures among hemodialysis patients, with variation by age and clinical subgroup. These findings support integrating periodontal screening and preventive strategies into hemodialysis care. Younger patients may benefit from early intervention to reduce infection and mortality risk, while older adults may require targeted skeletal protection.", "source": "PubMed"}

Responses from 112 institutions revealed that 81.2% either did not set general upper age limits or established limits at 80\u00a0years or older for definitive CRT in LA-NSCLC. The most common absolute contraindications were active interstitial pneumonia (60.7%) and contralateral hilar lymph node metastasis (42.0%). Relative contraindications involved dose-volume indices of the normal lung (70.5%). The most commonly adopted dose-volume indices were lung V20Gy\u2009<\u200930%, lung V5Gy\u2009<\u200960% and mean lung dose <20\u00a0Gy, while no definite indices were established for heart V50Gy and mean heart dose in half of the institutions.

Despite the high prevalence of mental illness, little is known about how students themselves perceive their mental health and which contextual and institutional factors influence these perceptions. This study examined mental health perceptions among university students in the Czech Republic, focusing on their views of the urban environment and preferred forms of support. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 767 students from four public universities. The 15-item questionnaire covered internal experiences, social background, and institutional conditions. Data were analysed using principal component analysis (PCA) and Welch's t-test to assess gender differences. Three components initially emerged: (1) subjective mental well-being, (2) contextual and interpersonal support, and (3) institutional determinants. However, due to low internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.285), Component 2 was excluded. The final interpretation therefore focused on two dimensions: subjective self-perception of mental health and social/institutional determinants. Gender differences were statistically significant for the latter, with women scoring higher. Students most often reported workload, social media, and family relations as stressors, while they valued cultural and educational opportunities of cities. The most frequently preferred forms of support included strengthening psychological services at universities, preventive care, and easier access to professional help. The findings indicate that students' mental health perceptions are shaped by individual, social, and institutional dimensions. Public health strategies should therefore extend beyond clinical treatment, strengthen preventive and community-based approaches, address gender differences, and enhance the role of universities as key sites of early intervention.", "source": "PubMed"}

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mainly developed by cigarette smoke (CS), is considered as a risk factor for COVID-19 severe symptoms. However, there is a gap in our knowledge of host-viral interactions for susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity. Equal numbers (n\u2009=\u200914) of K18-h (angiotensin-converting enzyme) ACE2 transgenic mice were randomized for sham air (SA) exposure as control group or CS group (2-h CS exposure per day) for 7 days. On Day 8, mice were randomly subdivided into mock infection (n\u2009=\u20096) and SARS-CoV-2 infection (n\u2009=\u20098) for 3 days. Lung tissues were harvested after sacrifice for analysis of viral susceptibility, morphological changes, host immune response, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. CS exposure increased viral susceptibility by upregulating virus binding receptors ACE2 and binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), subsequently causing ER stress via activation of activating transcription factor (ATF)6 pathway and protein kinase R (PKR) pathway, resulting in greater immune response and apoptosis. Prior CS exposure caused further deterioration of SARS-CoV-2-induced epithelial damage via the loss of epithelial junctions, ciliary dysfunction, mucus hypersecretion, and lung fibrosis. The current findings suggest that ER stress is likely to play a role in the deterioration of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury prior CS exposure.

Data from a number of public sources was used in this study, which represents a wide range of demographics. Class weights were implemented during training to balance the contribution of each class in order to address the class imbalance. Several pre-trained architectures, namely DenseNet, MobileNet, EfficientNetB0, and EfficientNetB3, have been investigated, and their performance was evaluated.

While CXR assessment for \"pulmonary congestion\" supports suspected-HF evaluation in evidence-based guidelines, the potential for systematic Pulmonary Venous Hypertension [PVH]-Staging to contribute to initial detection and scaling of LVDD is unclear. This study compared CXR-based PVH-Staging to Doppler Echocardiography [DEcho]-based LVDD-Grading in the absence of systolic dysfunction. Questions included: (1) With PVH-Staging performed by cardiothoracic radiologists, what intra-/inter-reader variabilities remain? (2) Does PVH-Staging track LVDD-Grading? and (3) Can AI-assisted PVH prediction of LVDD-Grade match human performance? CXR examinations of 1,682 (including 750 asymptomatic/healthy) subjects, without: (1) Anatomical/physiological confounders of DEcho or CXR examinations (\u2264\u200924\u00a0h apart), and (2) AI model-training confounders, were independently assigned 1 of 11 (9 PVH-related) Pulmonary Vasculature Patterns [PVPs] by 4 cardiothoracic radiologists and repeated for reliability evaluation. Expert-consensus Human Ground Truth [HGT] PVH PVPs were correlated with LVDD Grades (0 to 3-4), as were PVH-Rank predictions by a transformer-based AI model [\"PVPI\"]. Despite experience-dependent intra-/inter-reader reliability in PVP assignment, there was significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001) overall consistency. With increasing HGT PVH Stage, a significant (p\u2009<\u20090.001) trend towards increasing LVDD Grade was found; while PVH-Staging achieved confidence backing Grade 0/No LVDD, confident LVDD Grade recognition was not achieved until Grades 3-4/Restrictive Filling. However, a significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.001) stronger incrementally positive trend in PVPI PVH-Ranking with LVDD-Grading was demonstrated. Although validated, PVH-Staging for LVDD-Grading is limited by reader variabilities.

The goal was to support clinical decision-making and enhance early intervention for primary healthcare providers. Although asthma is manageable through outpatient care, its high hospitalization rate in Korea presents a significant healthcare burden. Therefore, early screening and targeted interventions are essential to improve patient outcomes. We analyzed data from 16,630 adults in the Korea Health Panel Survey (2014-2018), including 155 with asthma (J45-J46). We randomly split the data into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets. Using multivariable logistic regression, we identified significant predictors of asthma incidence. We then validated the nomogram using the concordance index (C-index), calibration plots, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and bootstrapping with 100 resamples. Our analysis identified male sex, age over 65, lower educational attainment, medical aid, and comorbidities as significant predictors of asthma. The model demonstrated good discriminatory power in the training set, with an area under the curve of 0.786 (95% confidence interval: 0.753-0.818) and a C-index of 0.798.

FA cases are becoming increasingly concerning in the United States, with rising trends in the pediatric population. However, increases have not been proportional across racial and/or ethnic groups, with studies that show rapid increases in minority populations. Objective: Due to this trend, we investigated if FA prevalence increased in patients at Texas Children's Hospital (TCH) based on race and gender. Methods: We retrospectively compared patients at TCH between the years 2013 and 2015 (time frame 1) and 2016 and 2018 (time frame 2). Patient FA history was diagnosed via medical diagnosis codes. Patients were stratified by gender and five race categories: Asian, black/African American (AA), Hispanic/Latino, non-Hispanic white, and \"other.\" The prevalence of an FA was calculated by dividing the number of patients with an FA by the total number of patients seen at TCH within a given race, gender, and time frame. The \u03c7\u00b2 test was used, and two-sided p-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The prevalence of an FA at TCH significantly increased within each race and gender except for patients who self-reported as \"other\" race. Asian patients had the highest increase in FAs among all the races between the two time frames. Black/AA American patients also had a clinically significant increase, with FA prevalence increased by 1.5 times from time frame 1 to 2. The prevalence increased more for male patients (0.43%) than for female patients (0.28%). The increase for male patients was similar to the increase for blacks (0.46%). Conclusion: FA prevalence increased for all race and gender subcohorts except for those who identified as \"other\" race, with clinically significant increases noted in males, Asian, and black/AA populations. This increase in FA prevalence suggests that there may be children of specific racial or ethnic groups who are at an increased risk of developing an FA.", "source": "PubMed"}

{"id": "41163254", "text": "BACKGROUND Wellens syndrome is a clinical entity characterized by specific electrocardiographic changes, often indicating critical stenosis in the high part of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), posing a high risk for myocardial infarction if untreated. Two electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns are described: Type A and Type B. CASE REPORT A 55-year-old female patient presented in emergency care with severe chest tightness and shortness of breath. Initial ECG showed sinus rhythm, a heart rate of 84/minute and no ST-segment changes. She was treated symptomatically and placed under observation. A follow-up ECG revealed biphasic, inverted T waves in precordial leads V2-V5, consistent with Wellens Type A. Coronary angiography demonstrated moderate (40%) diffuse narrowing of the proximal LAD, which was potentially functionally significant given the patient's symptoms and ECG findings, as well as mild subocclusion of diagonal branches 1 and 2. The left circumflex artery had 50% stenosis. Obtuse marginal branch 2 had 50% stenosis. The right coronary artery showed significant (70%) mid-segment stenosis. These findings indicate that Wellens-type ECG changes may occur in the setting of multi-vessel coronary artery disease and are not always linked to a single critical LAD lesion.

The understanding of how the virus infiltrates and impacts a diverse set of human cells is still incomplete. This work examined bulk RNA-seq data from recovered COVID-19 patients (COVID-19 survivors with or without post-acute complications) to uncover the persisting perturbations in biological pathways. The investigation also analyzed the transcriptomic signatures in the lungs and brain tissues of deceased patients during the acute phase of infection to understand COVID-19 impact on these organs. In recovered COVID-19 patients, the severity of acute COVID-19 influenced the subsequent disturbance of gene expression patterns in the post-acute disease phase. Gene expression patterns in the lungs and brain tissues of deceased COVID-19 patients correlate with the diverse pulmonary and neurological symptoms observed in these patients. We have detected significant alterations in the expression of mitochondrial genes, such as COX7C, COX7A2, ATP5PO, ATP5F1C and NDUFB8, which reflect a compensatory upregulation in response to viral suppression of mitochondrial function. This COVID-19 induced response persists up to 24 weeks post-infection, suggesting a sustained effort of the host to mitigate mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, in critical and severe COVID-19 cases, gradual upregulation of UBE3A expression was detected, which previously has been linked to favorable COVID-19 outcomes. Long-term anosmia related SHH gene was upregulated in recovered critically-ill COVID-19 patients. IL6 emerged as a central hub gene consistently expressed in both lung and brain tissues of deceased COVID-19 patients, underscoring its role in driving the inflammatory pathophysiology of COVID-19 within these organs. Collectively, our study emphasizes IL6 as a central cytokine driving the inflammatory response in both lung and brain tissues, and demonstrates the virus's capacity to induce long-lasting changes in nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene expression in the blood of recovered patients.

It is usually diagnosed on the basis of high neutrophil count in induced sputum (from >40% to >76%) with low eosinophils (<2%). The prevalence of NA ranges from 16% to 28% of the adult asthma population depending on the definitions and study methods applied. A clinical picture of NA is characterized by late onset of symptoms, higher exacerbation rate, lower level of symptoms control, and poorer response to steroids compared to eosinophilic phenotype. Comorbidities such as obesity and GERD as well as the influence of environmental factors (air pollution, smoking, bacterial infections) contribute to the development and severe course of the disease. NA is T2-low disease with predominantly Th1/Th17-type inflammation. Neutrophils are key cells responsible for initiating and sustaining inflammation. In addition to their primary functions like phagocytosis, degranulation, and NETosis, neutrophils release several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF) and chemokines (CXCL-1, -2, -8, -9, -10) responsible for the recruitment of other neutrophils or T cells.

{"id": "41218686", "text": "Most patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) can be managed effectively through standard therapeutic strategies. However, a significant proportion remains symptomatic, experiences recurrent exacerbations, or shows accelerated lung function decline despite apparently appropriate care. These patients often fall into what could be referred to as \"difficult-to-treat COPD\", a term still lacking formal definition. Drawing on parallels with asthma, this article proposes to consider the concept of disease control in COPD as a key driver of COPD management, not representing a fixed target but a dynamic construct reflecting daily impact and long-term stability. We provide a structured framework for reassessing diagnosis accuracy, evaluating treatment adequacy, and identifying unresolved pathophysiological drivers in patients who remain uncontrolled. Core domains include persistent dyspnea, chronic bronchitis, frequent or severe exacerbations, and rapid lung function decline. Each is explored with a focus on clinical reasoning, diagnostic tools, and phenotype- or endotype-based treatable trait-specific strategies. Importantly, the article argues that in patients remaining uncontrolled despite guideline-concordant care, the clinical response paradigm should shift from escalation to recharacterization. Practical pathways beyond standard care such as biologic therapy, lung volume reduction and transplantation, access to research protocols, and early integration of palliative care are reviewed. In the conclusion, we advocate for broader implementation of multidisciplinary case discussions and for using loss of disease control as a clinical trigger to prompt timely reassessment. Rather than defining a new phenotype, the aim is to promote a dynamic, precision-based approach to COPD management that aligns therapeutic strategies with evolving disease trajectories.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41126418", "text": "Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common, chronic inflammatory disorder of the upper respiratory tract, primarily caused by exposure to environmental allergens such as pollen, dust mites, and mold.

The underlying mechanism of AR involves an IgE-mediated immune reaction, with both immediate and delayed inflammatory responses contributing to ongoing symptoms. AR can be classified into several types-seasonal, perennial, occupational, and drug-induced-which aids in its diagnosis and personalized management. Key risk factors include hereditary susceptibility, environmental pollution, and modern lifestyle factors. Diagnosis is typically based on a detailed medical history, skin prick testing, and serum IgE measurements.

In surfactant-deficient states such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, alveolar collapse and impaired gas exchange may occur. Exogenous supplementation of surfactant phospholipids has been proposed to improve lung function. In this work, we performed LC-MS/MS analysis of phosphatidylcholines from a commercially available Essentiale phospholipid preparation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. The dynamics of BAL phosphatidylcholine levels in mice following intravenous and aerosol administration of Essentiale were investigated for the first time, revealing the time course and extent of pulmonary accumulation for each route. A 20-min aerosol inhalation of Essentiale (\u22483\u2009mg/kg phospholipids) achieved BAL phosphatidylcholine concentrations comparable to those obtained with a 500\u2009mg/kg intravenous dose. Repeated daily intravenous dosing caused a gradual increase in BAL phosphatidylcholine over 3-4\u2009days, whereas prolonged aerosol exposure beyond 20\u2009min did not further elevate BAL levels, likely due to uptake by alveolar cells.

{"id": "40985429", "text": "Background: Invasive aspergillosis with orbital apex and intracranial involvement is rare and often misdiagnosed due to nonspecific imaging findings. Misinterpretation may lead to inappropriate therapies, such as corticosteroids, which can exacerbate fungal infections. Case Presentation: A 50-year-old immunocompetent woman with diabetes mellitus presented with right ptosis and systemic malaise. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed three months prior had shown a subtle low-signal lesion in the right orbital apex. The lesion was small and thought to represent a granulomatous process, with minimal systemic inflammation and only mild surrounding changes on imaging. Biopsy was considered too invasive at that stage, and the patient was placed under observation. Over time, her condition progressed, and repeat imaging revealed intracranial extension, including involvement of the cavernous sinus and frontal lobe. Differential diagnoses included granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis, prompting empirical anti-tuberculosis treatment. However, the patient's condition worsened, and biopsy of the sphenoid sinus revealed septated fungal hyphae consistent with Aspergillus species on Grocott staining. Voriconazole therapy was initiated, resulting in significant clinical and radiological improvement. Discussion: This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of identifying orbital apex aspergillosis with early MRI changes and demonstrates the risk of misdiagnosis as granulomatous disease. Differentiating fungal infections from other inflammatory etiologies based on subtle imaging features is critical, especially when considering immunosuppressive therapy. Conclusion: Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for fungal infections in patients with progressive orbital apex lesions, even in the absence of classic immunosuppression. Early imaging review and biopsy are essential to prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.", "source": "PubMed"}

Despite the extent of venous changes, she denied constitutional symptoms, respiratory distress, or neurological compromise. Physical examination confirmed prominent collateral circulation, tracheal deviation, and absent breath sounds in the right apex. Laboratory investigations were within normal limits except for mild anemia and dyslipidemia. Computed tomography of the chest revealed a large bilobulated mediastinal mass, measuring 70 \u00d7 67 \u00d7 121 mm, compressing the superior vena cava and the brachiocephalic trunk, with associated venous dilatation. Differential diagnosis included thymoma, lymphoma, and germ cell tumor. Ultrasound-guided biopsy demonstrated malignant epithelial cells with tubulo-glandular architecture, consistent with adenocarcinoma. Unlike most malignant SVCS cases, which present acutely and demand urgent management, this patient remained clinically compensated for decades, highlighting the remarkable capacity of venous adaptation. The protracted course allowed a complete diagnostic workup and histopathological confirmation before therapeutic decisions were required.

Chest X-ray (CXR) images are highly valuable for early detection of lung diseases in monitoring and investigating pulmonary disorders such as COVID-19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. These CXR images offer crucial features about the lung's health condition and can assist in making accurate diagnoses. Manual interpretation of CXR images is challenging even for expert radiologists due to the overlapping radiological features. Therefore, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based image processing took over the charge in healthcare. But still it is uncertain to trust the prediction results by an AI model. However, this can be resolved by implementing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools that transform a black-box AI into a glass-box model. In this research article, we have proposed a novel XAI-TRANS model with inception based transfer learning addressing the challenge of overlapping features in multiclass classification of CXR images. Also, we proposed an improved U-Net Lung segmentation dedicated to obtaining the radiological features for classification. The proposed approach achieved a maximum precision of 98% and accuracy of 97% in multiclass lung disease classification. By leveraging XAI techniques with the evident improvement of 4.75%, specifically LIME and Grad-CAM, to provide detailed and accurate explanations for the model's prediction.", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41130781", "text": "Objective: Comparative study on the application value of bronchial ultrasound combined with different biopsy methods under thin-layer CT navigation in the diagnosis of malignant peripheral lung lesions. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients with suspected malignant peripheral lung lesions identified by chest CT from January 2019 to September 2024 at the Cancer Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, and Xianyang Central Hospital, who underwent routine bronchoscopy with negative results (209 cases). These patients were diagnosed using bronchial ultrasound under thin-layer CT navigation. The cases were divided into a cryobiopsy group (127 cases) and a conventional forceps biopsy group based on the biopsy method (82 cases). The diagnostic rates of the two groups were statistically analyzed, along with factors influencing the diagnostic rates. The tissue size obtained from both groups was compared, and the occurrence of complications was summarized. Results: This study included 209 cases with 216 peripheral lung lesions. A total of 209 cases with 210 lesions were successfully located through thin-slice CT guidance, resulting in a guiding success rate of 97.2% (210/216). Among the 130 lesions in the cryobiopsy group, 78 lesions were diagnosed as lung malignancies, with a diagnostic rate of 82.1% (64/78) for cryobiopsy in lung malignant lesions. In the forceps biopsy group, 46 of the 86 lesions were diagnosed as lung malignancies, with a diagnostic rate of 87.0% (40/46) for forceps biopsy in lung malignant lesions. There was no statistically significant difference between the two diagnostic rates (P=0.473). The average longest diameter of tissue obtained by cryobiopsy was (6.11\u00b10.23) mm, while the average longest diameter of tissue obtained by forceps biopsy was (1.58\u00b10.43) mm. There was a statistically significant difference in tissue longest diameter between the two groups (P\uff1c0.001). When the distance from the bronchoscopic tip to the lesion was \u22653 cm and the most distal bronchus visible under bronchoscopy was \u22645th generation, the diagnostic rate of forceps biopsy was higher [83.3%(25/30) and 94.1%(32/34)] than that of cryobiopsy [79.3%(23/29) and 78.0%(46/59)], and the difference was statistically significant (P\uff1c0.05). Regarding complications, one case (1.3%, 1/78) of clinically significant complications occurred in the cryobiopsy group, while no complications occurred in the forceps biopsy group. Conclusions: Under thin-layer CT navigation, bronchial ultrasound combined with different biopsy methods demonstrates a high diagnostic rate for malignant peripheral lung lesions and is safe to operate. Cryobiopsy allows for the collection of larger tissue specimens.", "source": "PubMed"}

In this study, a serotype A1 strain of Mannheimia haemolytica, designated as XJCJMh1, was isolated and identified from the lung tissue of a hybrid Simmental calf infected with Mycoplasma bovis. The pathogenicity of this strain was evaluated using Kunming mice as a model. The results indicated that infection with XJCJMh1 caused pathological manifestations such as pulmonary hemorrhage and edema in mice. Subsequently, the genome of this strain was sequenced and assembled using Illumina sequencing to obtain general genomic features. The genome was annotated and analyzed for gene functions using the Swiss-Prot, NR, GO, COG, KEGG, CAZy, TCDB, and Pfam databases. Additionally, the virulence factors and resistance genes of this strain were annotated using the PHI, VFDB, and CARD databases. The genome of Mannheimia haemolytica XJCJMh1 is 2,595,489 base pairs (bp) in length, with a GC content of 40.93%. Notably, this strain exhibits three distinct genomic islands and contains 98 effectors associated with the type III secretion system (T3SS). The XJCJMh1 strain harbors 74 virulence genes and 45 resistance genes. We annotated the proteins, genes, and associated GO and KEGG pathways of the XJCJMh1 strain; exploring the relationship between these annotations and the strain's pathogenicity is of considerable value. This study is of great significance for clarifying the pathogenic mechanism and genetic characteristics of the Mannheimia haemolytica strain XJCJMh1 in cattle, and its results provide a scientific reference for analyzing the genomic basis of pathogenicity and drug resistance of Mannheimia haemolytica under co-infection conditions.", "source": "PubMed"}

This study investigates four unique cases of forearm synovitis with rice body formation, hypothesizing that diverse underlying causes-rheumatoid arthritis, trauma, and idiopathic inflammation-contribute to this condition, and that surgical intervention ensures symptom resolution and prevents recurrence. The patients (three males, one female; aged 42-76 years) presented with heterogeneous clinical manifestations, including localized swelling, nerve compression symptoms, and restricted joint mobility. Diagnostic MRI revealed characteristic features: T1-weighted isointense masses with T2-weighted high-signal foci containing punctate low signals, aiding differentiation from other synovial pathologies. All patients underwent radical synovectomy with median nerve decompression, followed by histopathological analysis. Results demonstrated chronic granulomatous synovitis without evidence of infection (negative cultures and stains for tuberculosis, fungi, and bacteria). Postoperatively, all patients achieved complete symptom relief, with no recurrence or functional deficits observed during follow-up (9-22 months). Literature review highlighted the rarity of forearm rice bodies and underscored MRI's diagnostic superiority over radiography. The cases underscore that rice body formation, while historically linked to rheumatoid arthritis or tuberculosis, can arise from nonspecific synovial inflammation or trauma. Surgical excision combined with nerve release emerged as the definitive treatment, addressing both mechanical compression and inflammatory burden. This study emphasizes the importance of considering diverse etiologies in forearm synovitis, advocating for early MRI evaluation and tailored surgical management to optimize outcomes.

Building on constitutional principles, the study highlights how legality, necessity, and proportionality should be fundamental limits on emergency powers. It shows that the absence of detailed procedures and rights-protection mechanisms undermined these principles, leading to conflicts between public health and human rights.

Early diagnosis and prompt effective treatment are crucial for preventing disease progression and reducing both morbidity and mortality. These steps play a vital role in infection control and in lowering death rates at both individual and population levels. Although diagnostic methods have improved sufficiently in recent decades, TB can still present with ambiguous laboratory and imaging features. This ambiguity can lead to diagnostic pitfalls and potentially disastrous outcomes due to delayed diagnosis. In this article, we present a case of TB that was difficult to diagnose. The disease had invaded the mediastinum, right atrium, right coronary artery, and inferior vena cava (IVC), resulting in Budd-Chiari syndrome. This rare presentation created clinical, laboratory, and radiological confusion, resulting in a diagnostic dilemma that ultimately led to open cardiac surgery. The patient initially presented with progressive shortness of breath on exertion and fatigue, which suggested possible heart disease. This suspicion was reinforced by computed tomography (CT) imaging, which showed infiltrative mass lesions predominantly in the right side of the heart, invading the right coronary artery and IVC, with imaging features mimicking angiosarcoma. Although laboratory findings revealed an exudative effusion with lymphocyte predominance and elevated adenosine deaminase (ADA), the Gram stain was negative for bacteria, and an acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear was also negative. These findings contributed to diagnostic uncertainty and delayed the confirmation of TB. Open surgery with excisional biopsy and histopathological analysis ultimately confirmed TB. We conclude that TB should not be ruled out solely based on negative Mycobacterium bacteria in pericardial effusion or AFB smear. TB can mimic aggressive tumors such as angiosarcoma or lymphoma with invasion of the surrounding tissues and blood vessels.

{"id": "41166112", "text": "Mycobacterium avium complex disease is difficult to treat, with high failure and recurrence rates despite multidrug, macrolide-based treatments. The bacterial mechanisms involved in this drug tolerance and persistence are incompletely understood. Recent evidence has suggested persistence through metabolic adaptations indicative of the viable but nonculturable state, including a decreased respiratory rate and a switch to lipid accumulation and metabolism. To assess the contribution of switching to viable but nonculturable state to macrolide tolerance, we performed time-kill kinetics assays for clarithromycin against M. avium. In these experiments, we performed Auramine-O (for acid-fastness, representing active mycobacteria) and Nile red (for lipid accumulation) staining and stimulation using resuscitation-promoting factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Loss of auramine staining, increased Nile red staining and increased population sizes after stimulation with resuscitation-promoting factors support the hypothesis that clarithromycin induces a viable but nonculturable state in M. avium. Induction of a viable but nonculturable state is one of the mechanisms of macrolide tolerance in M. avium.

Evidence of concordance between the two methods for aeroallergens in children is limited. Potentially, discordance can lead to misclassification in atopy diagnosis and subsequent clinical management. The arbitrary sIgE cutoff value of 0.35 kUA/L is used uniformly for all allergens. Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the agreement between sIgE with a cutoff of 0.35 kUA/L and a positive SPT result (cutoff of 3 mm) for 10 aeroallergens and to investigate the sIgE level that corresponds best with a positive SPT result in school-age children. Methods: Measurement of sIgE and SPT for birch, Timothy grass, mugwort, horse, dog, cat, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, Alternaria, and Cladosporium were performed in 300 children ages 6 to 14 years: 132 children with asthma and 168 controls. The agreement between sIgE and SPT results for the individual aeroallergens was assessed by using the Cohen \u03ba coefficient with different sIgE cutoff values. Results: In total, the 300 children had 297 positive SPT results and 445 positive IgE analyses. The incidence of sensitization to Alternaria and Cladosporium was too low for further analysis. The agreement between the sIgE cutoff of 0.35 kUA/L and the SPT result cutoff of 3 mm was moderate to substantial for the remaining eight aeroallergens. The estimated optimal sIgE cutoff level that predicted an SPT result of \u22653 mm was 0.75 kUA/L for grass, horse, dog, and cat; 1.0 kUA/L for mugwort; 3.0 kUA/L for D. pteronyssinus; 5.0 kUA/L for birch; and 10.0 kUA/L for D. farinae. Using an sIgE cutoff of 0.75 kUA/L slightly increased the agreement for all eight allergens. Conclusion: Compared with an SPT result, a cutoff of 3 mm, analysis of our data suggests that an sIgE cutoff of 0.35 kUA/L is too low and that the optimal cutoff differs for the different aeroallergens.", "source": "PubMed"}

Considering this idea, we hypothesized hormonal therapies might influence the severity of COVID-19 in breast cancer (BC) patients. We mined the Emilia-Romagna region (Italy) registries to compare the rates of hospitalization and mortality by COVID-19 in 2020 amongst 22,987 BC patients treated with tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors (AIs), fulvestrant, and anti-HER2 therapies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab) in 2020, the latter used as reference group. The hospitalization rate observed in 4719 tamoxifen-treated BC patients was the lowest (0.61%, OR, 0.38; 90% CI, 0.20-0.76; p\u2009=\u20090.03) among hormonal therapies. Importantly, only one COVID-19 fatality was observed in tamoxifen-treated BC patients, who showed a striking 0.02% COVID-19 death frequency as compared to 0.24% observed for the whole BC patients population. In addition, tamoxifen emerged in the sex and age adjusted analysis as the only agent significantly decreasing the standard mortality rate (SMR) by COVID-19 as compared to the regional population consisting of 2,296,559 female residents from the Emilia Romagna region in 2020. Our results show that BC patients are at increased risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and that COVID-19 mortality is hindered by SERM-based therapies like tamoxifen. These findings are relevant to choose adequate treatments in order to protect cancer patients from concomitant SARS-CoV-2 contagion and related symptoms and contribute to the idea that SERMs could be used as prophylactic agents and therapeutics to prevent the progression of severity of COVID-19.", "source": "PubMed"}

Pregnant individuals may be uniquely susceptible to post-viral fatigue due to immunological and physiological adaptations during gestation. This review consolidates existing data regarding the prevalence, risk factors, and clinical implications of Long COVID-associated fatigue in pregnant individuals. A narrative review was conducted of studies examining fatigue among pregnant individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Key outcomes included fatigue prevalence, symptom persistence, associated risk or protective factors, and comparisons with non-pregnant populations. Across both the acute and post-acute stages of COVID-19, fatigue emerged as a consistently common symptom. Its prevalence and persistence varied significantly across studies, partly due to heterogeneity in assessment tools and follow-up durations. Severe acute illness, hospitalization, obesity, and smoking during pregnancy were linked to a higher risk of prolonged fatigue, whereas anosmia appeared to act as a potential protective factor. In contrast, comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, and lung disease were not significantly linked to fatigue risk. No consistent associations were found with maternal age or alcohol use. Long COVID-related fatigue presents a substantial burden in pregnancy, with implications for maternal health, quality of life, and postpartum recovery. Early recognition, individualized care strategies, and public health interventions targeting modifiable risk factors are essential to support this vulnerable population.

The optimal test to identify young children with Mtb infection remains controversial. Using a tuberculosis (TB) household contact (HHC) study design among 130 Ugandan children less than 5 years of age with Mtb exposure, this study was conducted to determine the following: (1) the prevalence of Mtb immune sensitization in young children heavily exposed to TB using both the tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) interferon gamma release assay, and to examine the concordance of these two tests; and (2) the diagnostic accuracy of TST and QFT-plus for confirmed and unconfirmed TB in young children. Prevalence of Mtb immune sensitization was determined using TST at both 5 mm and 10 mm thresholds for positivity; manufacturer's thresholds were utilized to establish QFT-Plus positivity. Concordance analysis between TST and QFT-Plus results was performed, including correlation between QFT-Plus tube TB.1 and tube TB.2. The sensitivity and specificity of TST and QFT-Plus for confirmed and unconfirmed TB was determined, and a logistic regression model was utilized to estimate the odds of TB. A 5 mm TST threshold identified the most children with Mtb sensitization (49.2%) and had moderate agreement with QFT-Plus (Cohen's Kappa 0.59). The odds of TB were two times higher among children with a positive TST using a 5 mm threshold. Concordance between 10 mm TST threshold and QFT-Plus was substantial (Cohen's Kappa 0.65), with higher concordance observed among older children (2-5 years). The QFT-Plus tube TB.1 and tube TB.2 results were highly correlated. Positive TST using a 5 mm threshold demonstrated the highest sensitivity for TB (60%), whereas QFT-Plus testing demonstrated the highest specificity (72%). Overall, our findings support that among a population of young, BCG-vaccinated children with heavy household exposure to TB, the TST using a 5 mm threshold identified more children with evidence of Mtb immune sensitization, and children with TB disease, than the QFT-Plus. These findings are highly relevant for children who are TB HHCs in endemic settings, and most at risk for TB following an exposure. We recommend that TST testing continue to be performed to assess for Mtb sensitization in young, TB-exposed children in TB-endemic settings to both prioritize provision of preventive therapy and to aide in diagnosis of pediatric TB.", "source": "PubMed"}

Objective: The objective was to adapt the UPDD for caregiver completion for patients ages 2-11 years. Methods: To inform modification of the UPDD, two iterative rounds of hybrid concept-elicitation/cognitive-debriefing interviews were conducted with clinical experts and caregivers of children with CSU recruited via patient organizations in the United States and Canada. After concept elicitation, the participants reviewed a draft UPDD-Caregiver Version with initial modifications for caregiver completion. Data were analyzed by using thematic analysis. Results: Four clinicians and 12 caregivers were interviewed (round 1:4 clinicians, 5 caregivers; round 2:7 caregivers). Key symptoms reported by the caregivers were itch (n = 12), hives (n = 12), and swelling and/or angioedema (n = 7). All four clinicians confirmed itch and hives to be key symptoms in children ages 2-11 years with CSU, with associated angioedema for some. Scratching was confirmed as the key observable sign of itch. Caregiver-reported impacts included waking in the night (n = 10); difficulty getting to sleep (n = 8); and daily life impacts, including activities at school (n = 10), play (n = 8), with family and/or friends (n = 4), and sports (n = 3). After round 1, minor revisions were made to enhance comprehension of the UPDD-Caregiver Version, and an overall symptom severity item was added. Relevance, acceptability, and comprehension of the final measure were confirmed by round 2 participants; no further changes were required. Conclusion: The UPDD-Caregiver Version is a relevant and acceptable measure for caregiver completion to assess symptoms and impacts of CSU in children ages 2-11 years.", "source": "PubMed"}

Evidently, airway clearance needs to be implemented in the patient's daily routine for a protracted period in order to ameliorate the clinical outcomes. High Flow therapy (HFT) has several physiologic effects and represents a valid therapy for various respiratory diseases. The aim of this study is to assess clinical and radiologic effects of long-term HFT in adult non-CF bronchiectasis. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective observational cohort study including adult patients affected by bronchiectasis and frequent exacerbations and hospitalizations. A chest HRCT was performed, and a quantitative evaluation of the scans was conducted applying a modified Bhalla score of five items. A total of 44 patients completed the follow up, 23 in the HF-group and 21 in the controls (No-HF group). Results: The median follow up was 41 months (range 36-48 months). The mean age was 65 years, 45% were females. After treatment the annual rate of exacerbations was significantly lower in the HF group (1.2 \u00b1 0.95 versus 3.5 \u00b1 1.0 per year, p < 0.0001). The annual rate of hospitalizations was significantly lower in the HF group (0.4 \u00b1 0.52 versus 1 \u00b1 0.93 per year, p = 0.01). The total score of the modified Bhalla improved after treatment in the HF group with a mean score of 5.32 versus 8.38, p = 0.034. The difference was substantially due to the lower score of mucoid impactions in the HF group. Conclusions: Bronchiectasis is an evolutive disease. Long-term HFT reduces the annual rate of exacerbation and hospitalization. In addition, HFT prevents mucoid impaction and potentially influences the radiological evolution of the disease.", "source": "PubMed"}

We report a case of an 86-year-old Chinese woman who presented with acute pain and swelling of her left ankle for two days, fevers and inability to bear weight. Past medical history included ischemic heart disease, congestive cardiac failure and recurrent urinary tract infections. Examination revealed a fever of 39.5\u00b0C and a tender, swollen ankle with restricted movement. Laboratory tests showed anaemia, lymphopenia and elevated C-reactive protein. Ankle X-ray was unremarkable. Joint aspiration yielded pus, but cultures were negative. Despite intravenous antibiotics, her symptoms persisted. MRI demonstrated marked ankle synovitis, and joint washout revealed pus around the ankle and flexor tendons. She subsequently became hypoxic, and chest imaging suggested possible miliary TB.

{"id": "41214790", "text": "Antibiotics are widely used in animal production for disease treatment, prevention, and as growth promoters at subtherapeutic doses. Across Africa, various antibiotic classes, including beta-lactams, macrolides, tetracyclines, phenicols, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and polymyxins, have been incorporated into animal feed to enhance growth and productivity. However, the continuous supplementation of animal feed with antibiotics exerts selective pressure on bacteria, accelerating the development of antibiotic resistance. This misuse in animal agriculture significantly contributes to the growing global threat of antibiotic resistance, affecting animal, human, and environmental health. Resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella species have been widely reported in animal, human, and environmental samples. The transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from animals to humans can occur through direct contact. It can also result from exposure to contaminated manure, wastewater, or consumption of contaminated animal products. This poses a major public health challenge in Africa. To mitigate antibiotic resistance, the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal farming must be restricted. Alternative feed additives such as probiotics, prebiotics, and phytobiotics have shown potential as sustainable replacements. Educating farmers on antibiotic risks and sustainable alternatives is crucial. Furthermore, governments must implement strict regulations to control the sale and misuse of antibiotics in livestock production. The review aims to present the harm of antibiotic misuse in livestock farming and emphasize the need for alternative growth promoters, ultimately reducing the burden of resistance across the continent.", "source": "PubMed"}

The incidence of MPE in patients of PCM is scarce\u00a0and often portends an aggressive disease course. We report the case of a 55-year-old male patient who presented with progressive dyspnea for three days along with complaints of nonspecific back pain for three months. The presence of bilateral pleural effusion on chest radiography prompted a clinical suspicion of tuberculosis, leading to pleural fluid analysis. Pleural fluid analysis revealed an exudative effusion with elevated adenosine deaminase levels. Cytomorphology and cell block study of the pleural fluid revealed atypical PCs and plasma blasts. PC lineage and clonality were confirmed by CD138 positivity and kappa light chain restriction. Based on the cytomorphology findings, a diagnosis of MPE was suspected. A monoclonal \"M\" spike was noted in the serum protein electrophoresis study. Concomitant biochemical investigations revealed hypercalcemia, anemia, and deranged renal function. Subsequent skeletal radiography showed the presence of lytic bone lesions, and bone marrow examination confirmed PCM with 70% PCs. A diagnosis of PCM with MPE was established. Despite repeated counseling, the patient declined treatment and succumbed within one month of diagnosis. This case highlights the diagnostic significance of pleural fluid cytology in conjunction with clinical, radiological, and\u00a0laboratory findings in identifying atypical presentations of PCM and also substantiates the poor prognosis associated with MPE.

Ad5 induced the most sustained antigen expression, but mRNA induced the most potent IFN responses, associated with robust antigen presentation and costimulation. Unlike Ad5 vaccines, which were hindered by preexisting vector immunity, mRNA vaccines retained efficacy after repeated use. As a single-dose regimen, Ad5 vaccines elicited higher immune responses.

In some situations, we can take advantage of the already available ground truth (GT) segmentation for an object in a subject at a particular respiratory phase to automatically segment the same object in the same subject at a different respiratory phase, and then refine the segmentation to create the final GT for all respiratory phases in the image of a subject. We anticipate that this process of creating GT would require minimal post hoc correction. In this spirit, we conducted separate experiments where we assumed to have GT of test subjects at the end expiration for scenario (1), end inspiration for (2), and end inspiration for (3).

Materials and Methods This retrospective single-center study included patients with COPD from a tertiary center between January 2011 and December 2015. CXR-Lung-Risk scores were derived from chest radiographs using an open-source AI algorithm. The primary outcome, respiratory mortality, was assessed for its association with CXR-Lung-Risk using a multivariable Fine-Gray model adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, comorbidities, and pulmonary function test results. Discrimination was evaluated and benchmarked against the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease grade using the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Associations between CXR-Lung-Risk and lung-function measures were examined. Results A total of 4226 patients (median age, 70 years [IQR, 63-76 years]; 3293 male) with COPD were evaluated. Respiratory mortality was observed in 19.7% (831 of 4226) of patients at a median follow-up of 6.7 years (IQR, 4.0-7.9 years). CXR-Lung-Risk was a prognostic factor for respiratory mortality (subdistribution hazard ratio per 5-year increase, 1.16; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.28; P < .001) after adjusting for lung function and clinical risk factors. Likelihood-ratio testing further confirmed its added value in multivariable models (P < .001). The AUC for CXR-Lung-Risk in predicting respiratory mortality up to 10 years was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.79), which outperformed the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease grades (0.61; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.65; P < .001). Pulmonary function decreased with increasing CXR-Lung-Risk scores (P < .001).

{"id": "40877428", "text": "The precise detection and localization of abnormalities in radiological images are very crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. To build reliable models, large and annotated datasets are required that contain disease labels and abnormality locations. Most of the time, radiologists face challenges in identifying and segmenting thoracic diseases such as COVID-19, Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, and lung cancer due to overlapping visual patterns in X-ray images. This study proposes a dual-model approach: Gated Vision Transformers (GViT) for classification and Swin Transformer V2 for segmentation and localization. GViT successfully identifies thoracic diseases that exhibit similar radiographic features, while Swin Transformer V2 maps lung areas and pinpoints affected regions. Classification metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-scores, surpassed 0.95 while the Intersection over Union (IoU) score reached 90.98%. Performance assessment via Dice Coefficient, Boundary F1-Score, and Hausdorff Distance demonstrated the system's excellent effectiveness. This artificial intelligence solution will help radiologists in decreasing their mental workload while improving diagnostic precision in healthcare systems that face resource constraints. Transformer-based architectures show strong promise for enhancing medical imaging procedures, according to the study results. Future AI tools should build on this foundation, focusing on comprehensive and precise detection of chest diseases to support effective clinical decision-making.", "source": "PubMed"}

Prevalence data for bronchiectasis remain limited in many parts of the world, and the available studies report heterogeneous results with overall prevalence rates reported between 52.5 and 1248.7\u2009per 100,000. Over the past 25\u2009years, the prevalence has steadily increased, likely due to increased awareness and improved diagnostic techniques. Bronchiectasis is most prevalent in older age groups, and it is more commonly found in females. It is associated with multiple comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and symptoms of anxiety and depression. First Nations populations experience a disproportionately high burden of disease. Bronchiectasis is more common in First Nations patients living in rural or remote communities and in those with socioeconomic disadvantage. It is associated with a lower age at diagnosis than the general population, more frequently associated with higher smoking rates and childhood respiratory tract infections, including a higher prevalence of human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 in Australian Indigenous populations. These factors contribute to more extensive bronchiectasis on imaging, higher exacerbation rates and greater mortality.

{"id": "41117887", "text": "Asthma is a heterogeneous disease characterized by respiratory involvement with wheezing, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and cough, along with systemic symptoms. The diagnosis of asthma predominantly relies on clinical history and bronchial hyperreactivity. However, due to its heterogeneity in manifestation, imaging can be a valuable option to support clinical examination. In fact, as stated by the latest guidelines, imaging examinations should not be routinely performed but should be tailored to the patient according to specific conditions or particular situations-such as exacerbation requiring advanced care, comorbidities, or severe asthma-that require further and more specific evaluation. The most common imaging findings in asthma are related to central and peripheral airway involvement, showing bronchial thickening and subsegmental bronchiectasis, along with additional radiographic features such as expiratory air trapping, inspiratory lung hyperinflation, and centrilobular micronodules. Despite having low specificity and sensitivity, chest X-ray is often the first examination performed due to its availability and usefulness in an emergency setting to identify complications as pneumothorax or superimposed infections. Among imaging techniques, HRCT remains the gold standard, allowing for the successful identification of both airway morphological changes (bronchial thickening) and parenchymal involvement related to asthma (centrilobular nodules and air trapping). Moreover, with the development of new techniques such as quantitative CT, more precise measurements of bronchial wall thickening can be done, establishing a potential correlation between HRCT imaging and data from pulmonary function tests. Despite being a promising and revolutionary technique, up to now MRI has played a marginal role in the evaluation of asthma, mainly restricted to assessing lung ventilation. However, recent studies are experimenting with MRI quantitative evaluation of bronchial wall dimensions with great results, which can be promising in the near future for new follow-up possibilities.

{"id": "41156192", "text": "Background/Objectives: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a T2-mediated disease characterized by dysphagia and food impaction. It is often associated with other atopic disorders and is considered a late manifestation of the \"atopic march\". In clinical practice, allergic comorbidities are frequently underdiagnosed and primarily based on self-reporting, potentially underestimating the true burden of T2-related pathology. To address this, a multidisciplinary task force was established at our tertiary center to systematically evaluate newly diagnosed patients with EoE. Methods: This cross-sectional observational study included patients referred for EoE evaluation from January 2022. Clinical history was collected prospectively, with systematic assessment for T2 comorbidities. All patients underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy with esophageal biopsies. Following EoE diagnosis, patients were referred to dermatology, ENT, immunology, and respiratory specialists. Results: A total of 43 patients were enrolled. Anamnestic T2 comorbidities were reported by 88% of patients. Rhinitis was the most common, while at baseline, no patients reported chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). After specialist evaluation, diagnoses of asthma, food allergy, and atopic dermatitis remained stable, while eight patients previously reporting rhinitis were newly diagnosed with CRSwNP. Overall, 65% of patients had \u22652 T2 comorbidities in addition to EoE, and 25% had \u22653. Conclusions: Our findings support a multidisciplinary approach to assess T2 comorbidities in patients with EoE, with a high overall prevalence (95.3%) and frequent coexistence of multiple atopic conditions. CRSwNP was frequently underdiagnosed and only identified after rhinofibroscopy. Although our data needs to be confirmed in larger multicenter studies, our results suggest that relying solely on patient-reported history or single-specialty evaluation risks underestimating the systemic nature of the T2 inflammatory pathway in EoE.", "source": "PubMed"}

About one-third of VAPs can cause bloodstream infections. MDR A. baumannii causing VAP is associated with significant longer hospital stays and mortality. We carried out the genomic analysis of MDR A. baumannii by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to study the various virulence factors involved in biofilm formation and pathogenic mechanisms. A total of 44 MDR A. baumannii isolates recovered from respiratory and blood specimens of patients on mechanical ventilators are included in the study. All isolates were identified by Vitek2 and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and confirmed by WGS. Different virulence factor (VF) genes identified by WGS were analyzed. The most common VF genes found in all isolates of A. baumannii were ompA (97.7%) and lps-o gene (100%) related to adherence, adeF (100%), adeG (95.5%), and adeH (97.7%) (AdeFGH efflux pump-related VF genes) and pgaA and pgaD (100%), pgaB and pgaC (97.7%) related to biofilm formation, plc and plcD (100%) related to enzyme and immune evasion related capsular gene (100%) and lpsB, lpxA, lpxC, lpxD, lpxL, and lpxM found in all isolates respectively.

The specific, sensitive, and adaptable nature of the CRISPR-Cas systems has led to the development of innovative solutions for the detection of diseases, including viral and bacterial infections. This review provides an overview of the CRISPR-Cas systems and mainly focuses on the application of CRISPR-based assays for the detection of Bordetella pertussis, which is the main causative agent of a highly infectious disease, whooping cough. The review emphasizes the need for novel diagnostic tools for B. pertussis, along with highlighting some future perspectives, since its diagnosis can be challenging due to nonspecific early symptoms and interference from closely related Bordetella species. In this regard, CRISPR-based diagnostic platforms can offer a promising avenue for rapid and accurate detection of B. pertussis, helping the management of whooping cough.", "source": "PubMed"}

{"id": "41156264", "text": "Objectives: To evaluate the prevalence, classification, and clinical relevance of incidental extracardiovascular findings in pre-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) CT imaging. Methods: We conducted a retrospective single-center study of 225 patients undergoing pre-TAVI contrast-enhanced, ECG-gated CT scans between 2021 and 2023. Extracardiovascular findings were recorded and categorized into three groups based on presumed clinical relevance: Group A (findings with no need for follow-up), Group B (findings requiring follow-up), and Group C (findings requiring immediate intervention or treatment). Statistical analysis included a descriptive assessment of the overall prevalence of incidental findings and evaluation of age- and sex-related trends using chi-square tests with Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons. Results: The study cohort included 225 patients (53.3% male; mean age 79.9 \u00b1 6.2 years, range 58-93). Extracardiovascular incidental findings were detected in 205 patients (91.1%). Among all 478 recorded findings, 82.6% were Group A, 14.4% Group B, and 2.9% Group C. On a per-patient level, 87.1% had at least one Group A finding, 24.9% had at least one Group B, and 6.2% had at least one Group C finding. Older age was associated with more incidental findings, with a significant difference observed between the 70-79 and 80-89 age groups (p = 0.002). No significant sex-related differences were found (p = 0.226). Findings were most frequently located in the abdomen (46.2%) and thorax (37.2%). Among all clinically relevant findings, the thorax was the most commonly affected region: 43.5% of Group B and 78.6% of Group C findings were located in the thorax, followed by the abdomen (33.3% of Group B and 7.1% of Group C findings). Conclusions: Extracardiovascular incidental findings are highly prevalent in pre-TAVI CT imaging and range from benign, age-related changes to potentially serious conditions such as malignancies or infections. Their presence reflects the comorbidity burden of the typical TAVI population and underscores the importance of recognizing non-vascular incidental findings in this clinical setting.", "source": "PubMed"}

Pericarditis accounts for 0.2% of all cardiovascular admissions and myopericarditis is even more rare with an unknown exact incidence.2 These pathologies can present with a wide spectrum of complaints varying from a simple case of chest pain to more severe hypotensive pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.2 Since these pathologies primarily affect the younger patient population,2 they require careful consideration by the Emergency Physician (EP) as well as a systematic comprehensive approach to managing these critically ill patients. The majority of cases are of idiopathic origin; however, the causes of pericarditis are divided into infectious and noninfectious, with infectious cases primarily resulting from viral infections.3 Causes of myocarditis, on the other hand, can be divided into infectious, immune-mediated, and toxic.2 Although myopericarditis is a rare disease, its high acuity makes it an important case to enhance the educational experience of emergency medicine residents and their associated faculty.", "source": "PubMed"}

This study assessed the real-world efficacy of BDP/FF/G on lung function and diaphragmatic workload in patients with uncontrolled asthma. Methods: A prospective observational study enrolled 21 adult patients diagnosed with uncontrolled asthma despite high-dose ICS/LABA therapy. Patients underwent lung function tests and right diaphragmatic ultrasound assessments at baseline and after three months of treatment with BDP/FF/G (172/5/9 mcg, administered as two inhalations every 12 h). Results: After three months, significant improvements were observed in FEV1 (from 57.75 \u00b1 12.30% to 75.10 \u00b1 18.94%, p < 0.001) and FEF25-75 (from 47.80 \u00b1 19.23% to 75.10 \u00b1 36.06%, p < 0.001).

Additionally, both the SMs and AMO, as well as their synergistic combinations, were docked to molecular targets associated with resistance and virulence in S. aureus and K. pneumoniae. The drug-protein complexes showed favorable interaction energies, confirming that the binding free energy of the synergistic combinations was superior to that of the individual compounds. Overall, the most significant differences in activity between combined and isolated treatments were observed for MurD in S. aureus and SidA in K. pneumoniae.

{"id": "41139354", "text": "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a vital life support technique employed in patients experiencing pulmonary or cardiopulmonary failure. This procedure entails the use of a pump to replace heart function and an oxygenator to ensure adequate blood oxygenation. ECMO systems are categorized into two main configurations: veno-venous (VV) and veno-arterial (VA) circuits. VV-ECMO is employed for isolated respiratory failure, while VA-ECMO provides temporary mechanical circulatory support for patients with cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. A less common alternative, veno-arterial-venous (VAV) ECMO, may be used in complex cases, reducing left ventricular afterload, leading to an improvement of pulmonary edema. Imaging plays a pivotal role in ECMO management, particularly in confirming proper cannula placement, detecting malposition or migration, and identifying complications such as hemorrhage, thrombosis, vascular injury, or infections. Chest X-ray serves as the first-line imaging modality, while computed tomography (CT) is essential for a more detailed evaluation in cases of suspected complications. Tailored CT protocols, adapted to specific ECMO configurations, contrast injection site, cardiac output, and ECMO flow rate, are essential to account for possible ECMO-induced hemodynamic changes and ensure accurate diagnosis. This review provides a comprehensive guide for radiologists, offering detailed descriptions of ECMO system configurations, cannula positioning, and imaging techniques. It highlights the importance of understanding ECMO-specific challenges and outlines strategies to optimize imaging protocols, including modifications in contrast administration and flow-rate adjustments, ultimately improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. CRITICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Radiologists must be familiar with VV- and VA-ECMO systems, utilize tailored CT protocols, and apply non-invasive imaging modalities to assess cannula positioning and complications, ensuring accurate evaluation and management of critically ill patients relying on these advanced life-support techniques. KEY POINTS: ECMO is a life support technique used in patients with pulmonary or cardiopulmonary failure. CT protocols should be customized based on the study indication, ECMO configuration, contrast injection site, cardiac output, and ECMO flow rate. Non-invasive imaging is crucial for evaluating cannula placement and identifying complications. Approximately 50% of ECMO patients develop complications, the most frequent being hemorrhage, thromboembolic disease, renal failure, sepsis, and vascular injury.", "source": "PubMed"}

Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contributed 1\u00b745 billion (1\u00b731-1\u00b761) global DALYs in 2010, increasing to 1\u00b780 billion (1\u00b763-2\u00b703) in 2023, alongside a concurrent 4\u00b71% (1\u00b79-6\u00b73) reduction in age-standardised rates. Based on DALY counts, the leading level 3 NCDs in 2023 were ischaemic heart disease (193 million [176-209] DALYs), stroke (157 million [141-172]), and diabetes (90\u00b72 million [75\u00b72-107]), with the largest increases in age-standardised rates since 2010 occurring for anxiety disorders (62\u00b78% [34\u00b70-107\u00b75]), depressive disorders (26\u00b73% [11\u00b76-42\u00b79]), and diabetes (14\u00b79% [7\u00b75-25\u00b76]). Remarkable health gains were made for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases, with DALYs falling from 874 million (837-917) in 2010 to 681 million (642-736) in 2023, and a 25\u00b78% (22\u00b76-28\u00b77) reduction in age-standardised DALY rates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, DALYs due to CMNN diseases rose but returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. From 2010 to 2023, decreases in age-standardised rates for CMNN diseases were led by rate decreases of 49\u00b71% (32\u00b77-61\u00b70) for diarrhoeal diseases, 42\u00b79% (38\u00b70-48\u00b70) for HIV/AIDS, and 42\u00b72% (23\u00b76-56\u00b76) for tuberculosis. Neonatal disorders and lower respiratory infections remained the leading level 3 CMNN causes globally in 2023, although both showed notable rate decreases from 2010, declining by 16\u00b75% (10\u00b76-22\u00b70) and 24\u00b78% (7\u00b74-36\u00b77), respectively. Injury-related age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 15\u00b76% (10\u00b77-19\u00b78) over the same period. Differences in burden due to NCDs, CMNN diseases, and injuries persisted across age, sex, time, and location. Based on our risk analysis, nearly 50% (1\u00b727 billion [1\u00b718-1\u00b738]) of the roughly 2\u00b780 billion total global DALYs in 2023 were attributable to the 88 risk factors analysed in GBD. Globally, the five level 3 risk factors contributing the highest proportion of risk-attributable DALYs were high systolic blood pressure (SBP), particulate matter pollution, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG), smoking, and low birthweight and short gestation-with high SBP accounting for 8\u00b74% (6\u00b79-10\u00b70) of total DALYs. Of the three overarching level 1 GBD risk factor categories-behavioural, metabolic, and environmental and occupational-risk-attributable DALYs rose between 2010 and 2023 only for metabolic risks, increasing by 30\u00b77% (24\u00b78-37\u00b73); however, age-standardised DALY rates attributable to metabolic risks decreased by 6\u00b77% (2\u00b70-11\u00b70) over the same period. For all but three of the 25 leading level 3 risk factors, age-standardised rates dropped between 2010 and 2023-eg, declining by 54\u00b74% (38\u00b77-65\u00b73) for unsafe sanitation, 50\u00b75% (33\u00b73-63\u00b71) for unsafe water source, and 45\u00b72% (25\u00b76-72\u00b70) for no access to handwashing facility, and by 44\u00b79% (37\u00b73-53\u00b75) for child growth failure. The three leading level 3 risk factors for which age-standardised attributable DALY rates rose were high BMI (10\u00b75% [0\u00b71 to 20\u00b79]), drug use (8\u00b74% [2\u00b76 to 15\u00b73]), and high FPG (6\u00b72% [-2\u00b77 to 15\u00b76]; non-significant).", "source": "PubMed"}
{"id": "41092926", "text": "Our findings underscore the complex and dynamic nature of global health challenges. Since 2010, there have been large decreases in burden due to CMNN diseases and many environmental and behavioural risk factors, juxtaposed with sizeable increases in DALYs attributable to metabolic risk factors and NCDs in growing and ageing populations. This long-observed consequence of the global epidemiological transition was only temporarily interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The substantially decreasing CMNN disease burden, despite the 2008 global financial crisis and pandemic-related disruptions, is one of the greatest collective public health successes known. However, these achievements are at risk of being reversed due to major cuts to development assistance for health globally, the effects of which will hit low-income countries with high burden the hardest. Without sustained investment in evidence-based interventions and policies, progress could stall or reverse, leading to widespread human costs and geopolitical instability. Moreover, the rising NCD burden necessitates intensified efforts to mitigate exposure to leading risk factors-eg, air pollution, smoking, and metabolic risks, such as high SBP, BMI, and FPG-including policies that promote food security, healthier diets, physical activity, and equitable and expanded access to potential treatments, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. Decisive, coordinated action is needed to address long-standing yet growing health challenges, including depressive and anxiety disorders. Yet this can be only part of the solution. Our response to the NCD syndemic-the complex interaction of multiple health risks, social determinants, and systemic challenges-will define the future landscape of global health. To ensure human wellbeing, economic stability, and social equity, global action to sustain and advance health gains must prioritise reducing disparities by addressing socioeconomic and demographic determinants, ensuring equitable health-care access, tackling malnutrition, strengthening health systems, and improving vaccination coverage.

{"id": "41178654", "text": "Netherton syndrome (NS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by SPINK5 mutations, leading to LEKTI deficiency and skin barrier dysfunction. It manifests as ichthyosis, trichorrhexis invaginata (bamboo hair), and atopic diathesis, including food allergies, asthma, and elevated IgE levels. Early genetic testing is key for accurate diagnosis and treatment. We report a case of a two-year-old girl initially diagnosed with atopic dermatitis, presenting with severe, persistent skin issues from infancy. The symptoms included dry, scaly, and inflamed skin, along with elevated IgE levels and polysensitization to food allergens. Trichorrhexis invaginata was identified, and genetic testing confirmed NS. Despite treatments with corticosteroids and emollients, the patient continued to experience flare-ups, leading to the use of biological therapy, specifically secukinumab, due to persistent skin barrier dysfunction. NS is often misdiagnosed due to its overlap with atopic dermatitis, especially in early stages. Mutations in SPINK5 vary in severity, influencing treatment outcomes. Current therapies, including corticosteroids, emollients, and immunomodulators, provide limited relief. New treatments like IVIG, retinoids, and biologics (e.g., secukinumab, dupilumab) show promise in managing inflammation and restoring the skin barrier, with secukinumab targeting IL-17A showing significant improvements. The psychosocial impact of NS affects the patient's quality of life, causing anxiety, social withdrawal, and family stress. Early genetic testing, targeted therapies, and psychosocial support are crucial for managing NS.

{"id": "40707089", "text": "The survey included 204 patients, five of whom (2.5%) had history of previously treated TB. The proportion of TST positive patients was 12.3% after the first test and increased to 21.1% after the second test. Patients previously treated for TB were more likely to have positive TST (80 vs 20.1%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). We screened 184 patients for TB disease; 16.3% were symptomatic, 15.8% had CXR abnormality and 6.5% were symptomatic with CXR abnormality. Additionally, 13.6% of patients had physical signs consistent with extra-pulmonary TB without symptoms or CXR abnormality. Based on these findings, high probability of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB was found in 38.6% and 13.6% of patients respectively and they were referred for bacteriological confirmation. We diagnosed LTBI and prescribed TPT to 9.2% of screened patients.", "source": "PubMed"}

{"id": "41193050", "text": "In rectal cancer, because of the need for high-resolution anatomic detail in determining local tumor extension, imaging for local staging and restaging of the primary tumor in the pelvis is considered separately from the evaluation of distant metastatic disease in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, often resulting in the need for a combination of modalities to fully stage the patient. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.", "source": "PubMed"}
